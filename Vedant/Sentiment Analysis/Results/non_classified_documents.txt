in fashion for doormen few frills some fray blocked due to copyright see full page image or microfilm by dee wedemeyer there was a time when you could tell a douglas l el liman doorman by the monogrammed buttons on his uniform but now that gibbons ives are part of the company that button is outdated and their doormen like many of the citys doormen keep their uniforms buttoned with a standard crest button bearing the motto spectemur agendo let us be known by our actions of course the pierre hotel still has gold plated buttons for its doormens uniforms and tudor city still has a silver colored button marked tc but with costs of all kinds rising rapidly many buildings particularly co ops are asking whether the blocked due to copyright see full page image or microfilm blocked

but some have started having staff share uniforms or wear hand me downs and a number are allowing shirtsleeves in summer carl glassman doormen themselves are really necessary let alone fancy uniforms after all aside from economics this is a time when even the starchiest tenants may feel more at home in t shirts than suits and ties the major uniform manufacturers insist buildings are not cutting back on uniforms but a spotcheck of some of the finer addresses revealed doormen wearing frayed jackets or hand me downs from laid off colleagues many old established buildings and some of the new

even in summer continued from page 1 summer even on park avenue doormen can be spotted in shirtsleeves which was unheard of not long ago new yorkers have always taken an interest in the appearance of doormen and other members of the building staff according to fare thee well a history of the nations hotels spas and resorts by leslie dorsey and janice devine crown the old gilsey hotel was the first to put staff in livery in 1871 newspapers noted that the boys didnt care much for the gold braid and buttons but within the year practically all the fashionable new york hotels had liveried attendants the authors said the waldorf astoria required all its staff to shave their moustaches and beards creating another furor the authors said over the years styles have evolved probably derived from some combination of the butlers attire servants livery and the sometimes military inspired uniforms of doormen at some of the grand european hotels in fact according to a spokesman for local 32b 32j of the service employees international union one thing that attracted many european immigrants to the job were the impressive uniforms edward elliman president of douglas elliman gibbons ives one of the biggest management companies said there was a time when his father or someone else from the company would make rounds inspecting employees attire once he said he was with his father when he found a doorman drunk his hat on backward his tie off to one side and his shirt unbuttoned the man was dismissed in one old wealthy building he knows of mr elliman said the owners first air conditioned the lobby then questioned the value of jackets in hot weather when most of the owners are out of town anyway years ago he said a building managed by the company would frequently take the agents recommendation and the uniforms would bear the elliman name today owners are more likely to want the address or the buildings name on the uniform and hat once mr elliman said a building had the idea of putting the employees in a zouave inspired outfit of red turban baggy white pants and blue jacket but they were talked out of it by wiser heads he said custom made uniforms cost about 150 more for an overcoat and in the buildings with the best dressed staff a doorman gets one or perhaps two summer uniforms and two winter uniforms three or four shirts and ties a winter and a summer hat an overcoat gloves and sometimes a raincoat according to walter schwab the president of allbilt uniform corooration a company that makes uniforms for many apartment houses there are buildings that have the doorman in one year round uniform and there was a building that had three men on sequential shifts sharing one overcoat ira legon president of appel brooks webber which specializes in custom uniforms for commercial buildings and hotels said the uniform business was set back with the automation of elevators but picked up again in recent years mr legon who does business nationwide said new york city businesses are conservative sticking close to styles featuring valencian vests and velvet trim unlike places further west that often go in for more unusual costume like designs such as the hotel that had a uniform with a british campaign helmet new york is not the best example to show the versatility of our industry mr legon said they are not about to have their guys running around in shorts of course the place we sell the most bermuda shorts is bermuda we do a lot of hotels down there gen john j pershing a world war i hero has had a large influence on doormens hats many of which bear the visored style he wore mr legon said and russian style fur hats are popular with some hotels in winter despite the formality of many doormens outfits he said top hats are not popular here because of the weather they blow off or get wet theres always a problem getting a rain cover for atop hat said mr legon hats on doormen are extremely treacherous judging from all bilts catalog buildings have all sorts of styles from which to choose they range from a link button tuxedo style to two three four and even more buttons either single breasted or double breasted some choose tailcoats with wing collars worn with bow ties or wing collars with as cots in many buildings managed by douglas elliman gibbons ives ap some of the latest doormens styles from all bilt a uniform manufacturer parently somewhat of a style arbiter in the industry the doormen frequently wear light gray summer weight clothes in the warmer months and darker gray blue or black in winter brown harris stevens inc gives its employees bars representing a year of employment with a star after five years dark green and brown are popular colors also charles h greenthal co inc has moved from a custom tailored uniform to an off the shelf uniform that can be fitted in about a week the uniform is a blue blazer black pants and bow tie greenthals one doorwoman at 300 east 71st street wears a more fitted blazer and pants with flared legs co op boards have been known to debate for hours details of a uniform rules have been made about just how hot it has to be before the doormen can remove their jackets and interior designers have been asked to color coordinate the uniforms with the lobby most of the doormen interviewed last week during a swing up park avenue fifth avenue central park west west end avenue and riverside drive seemed to take their uniforms in stride as just part of the job but others wished the management would ask them before selecting a uniform at 145 central park west one of the entrances to the san remo a doorman and a lobbyman said they would like bermuda shorts with knee socks they thought it would be cooler in summer they would like something in a light blue light gray or beige with a contrasting stripe instead of the dark gray color of the present uniform some thing smart like the help said the lobby man the doorman also said he could use a different hat because the present one had a habit of flying off on windy days he said he had already lost two that flew off over the wall into central park at the majestic on central park west at 72d street john mulhall a college student who sported three bars on his cuff said he liked the buildings uniform but would prefer instead of the summer gray a light blue one that he had noticed on the employees of the dakota across the street nevertheless he said after the weather reached 85 degrees the management allowed them to take off their jackets and the present uniform was a huge improvement over the previous one which he said had a wing collar those old uniforms were time consuming said mr mulhall by the time you found your collar button if you hadnt lost it the work tends to be hard on clothes carrying packages and luggage puts a sheen on a suit rapidly doormen who have only one suit for each season have to have it cleaned on their days off you get caught in the rain once and the crease is shot said alexander ba stone a doorman at 630 park avenue at 66th street but some doormen also lament the passing of a more polished era now his hair said a lobby man at the san remo pointing to his colleagues hair which was poking out below his hat he would never have gotten away with that everything has changed its gotten so if you come in with a beard you can work

katy tex when hurricane harvey struck houston floodwaters swept through eileen and jeff swanson s two story brick home blanketing the first floor in muck and nearly destroying a domestic existence 12 years in the making their china cabinet in the family for three generations was reduced to a sodden mess a couch once a soft red had blushed into a watery burgundy the carpet squished like grass at the bottom of a marsh a dirty foot high water line ran wall to wall marking the local crest of an event that the national weather service called the most significant tropical cyclone rainfall event in united states history after the floodwaters receded the swansons returned to a house ravaged endless questions few answers and a looming decision they are not alone hundreds of homeowners in canyon gate at cinco ranch a quiet subdivision in a west houston suburb are mired in a slow frustrating effort to rebuild others have formed an uneasy exodus their attachment to familiar places and routines irreparably battered by a storm that dumped 50 plus inches and caused widespread flooding they are now selling their gutted homes at well below pre storm prices the fundamental decision stay or go is one being faced by homeowners all around the houston area as climate change increases the frequency and intensity of storms like harvey no neighborhood is immune from being flooded again but the swansons and other homeowners in canyon gate face a far more certain prospect their neighborhood is on land that was designed to be flooded it is part of a reservoir that was built by the united states army corps of engineers in the 1940s to prevent catastrophic flooding downtown a fact that developers did little to publicize when they built canyon gate in the 1990s on a blistering september afternoon at the swanson house 20 box fans and an industrial blower ran nonstop in a battle against rot and decay the family was still consigned to five rooms upstairs and ms swanson 48 a senior executive assistant at an industrial automation company was downstairs watching a youtube demonstration of how to hang wallboard at the top of the steps mr swanson 52 was compiling a mental to do list make another trip to home depot haul more stuff to the storage unit get back in time to help with the delivery of a stack of new wallboard their 23 year old son allen who is severely developmentally disabled was watching television it was already a familiar routine it feels like our life is somewhere between where do i start and why isn t this getting done mr swanson said there was a lot keeping the swansons in canyon gate they had paid off the house purchased in 2006 for 225 000 just a few months before the flood that freed them from a monthly mortgage the home was close to their younger son nick s school and in a neighborhood they loved and they had adapted the space to suit allen s disabilities he has seizures so they needed open areas where they could watch him from other parts of the house in a hundred different ways floods or no floods this was their home and yet the case for leaving was clear two weeks before the floods mr swanson had quit his job as a security guard with the intention of looking for work without so many late hours the swansons had some savings but the money was meant to pay for nick 17 a high school junior to attend college with only one income there was little money left over for repairs and renovations that would cost upward of 60 000 hanging over the entire process was the knowledge that a similar or even worse flood could hit again possibly even as soon as the next hurricane season i am pretty sure we would not have moved into this house if we knew ms swanson said it s worth saving hugh durlam knew he was staying as a 13 year resident and former homeowners association board member mr durlam was completely invested in canyon gate but he wanted to know what happened to others in the neighborhood so on the canyon gate facebook page he administers he recently posted a survey asking homeowners if renovations were completed or close to completion if they were still rebuilding or if they had not yet started of the 202 responses all but two were involved in some kind of renovation this is going to be a brand new 20 year old community it s worth saving said mr durlam who works for a houston engineering firm he supports a plan to deepen the reservoir and build a levee to protect the neighborhood he said something that should have been done a long time ago christina raena micu isn t certain about what to do next when harvey hit she anxiously watched television footage of the storm from a dallas hotel room where she had taken shelter with her husband and two of her three children her 20 year old son had stayed behind sending dispatches as the waters invaded their neighborhood before finally evacuating in chest deep water with only a backpack inside ms micu s home everything on the first floor was submerged within or floating atop a couple of feet of muddy water when she returned from dallas she rushed to her bedroom hoping her collection of childhood photos had somehow survived she had left the photo albums in a pile on the carpeted floor with plans to one day organize them on a bookshelf they were stuck together the images swirled into watercolor blurs too damaged to save but what she saw next was more immediately concerning mold i have a 5 year old son with asthma who has already been hospitalized once for it she said i can t just move back in it s much more complicated than that for me after she moved her family into an apartment about 10 minutes away signing a one year lease with some financial assistance from the federal emergency management agency ms micu a real estate investor embarked on a monthslong renovation of her flood soaked home ripping out the floors and walls and repeatedly treating the house with mold bombs foggers and air purifiers almost every day ms micu weighed her choices some days she was sure she would stay the house was in a safe neighborhood roomy with a swing set in the backyard before the storm she was even planning an addition other days she knew moving was her only choice both options were expensive selling meant taking a big hit she paid 183 000 for the house six years ago and figured it was not worth much more than half of that now but for as long as they lived in their temporary apartment she was paying rent and a mortgage fema gave her about 16 000 but the renovation bids were all around 70 000 by the time the four bedroom house passed a mold test in february ms micu was thinking that she might split the difference move her family elsewhere but keep the house as a rental with my son s immune system i can t have a situation where the mold is a trigger said ms micu a houston native whose parents are filipino immigrants i can t take the chance something else was nagging ms micu she wondered how the subdivisions could have been built in a reservoir and if they had to be sacrificed shouldn t the homeowners be compensated this pushed our lives in another path she said how could we have known that we would return from dallas and practically have to start over the questions are what pushed her to look for a law firm in september she became one of the lead plaintiffs in a federal class action suit against the army corps of engineers harvey took away my photo album with pictures from every year of my life it took so many things it took the purse that my husband bought me as a gift he spent three months looking for it she said harvey took away my sense of security but so did the army corps of engineers what happened to us was wrong starting overwhen paulette delynn archer 70 greets a visitor in the doorway of her one story brick house she is framed by large picture windows that reveal the emptiness inside where flooding and renovation have left little more than wood studs between the front door and the back patio come in let me show you the house ms archer offered in a cheery voice that soon gave way to silence well this used to be my house now it s just a shell ms archer had once delighted in having guests over to see her four bedroom home where everything was the color of soft gold or pumpkin this is where she had raised her only son where her husband and mother spent their final days where she had planned to spend her remaining days but the four feet of mud and water that gushed through the house had demanded something radically different two decades ago ms archer and her husband had paid roughly 200 000 for the house and watched it appreciate to more than 300 000 she said it would cost well over 100 000 to renovate the house and her fema grant would only cover a small fraction in the mornings while staying at a la quinta inn ms archer would make lists in a blue three ring binder of items lost mostly items that came to her in her dreams i finally stopped trying to sum up my entire life it was just too stressful but that list told me that as much as i loved my house there was no way out of this but to sell said ms archer who spent the first part of her career as a flight attendant then became a police officer for the port of houston authority i couldn t get a loan at my age and with no job how would i pay it back she had lost everything once before as a teenager in a house fire the crushing loss felt the same the inability to recover felt far different like other homeowners ms archer said she had no idea the house was built in a reservoir she was told over and over that she did not need flood insurance she said two or three times she purchased it anyway and then let the policy expire three years earlier she had taken out a reverse mortgage which allows homeowners over 62 years old to convert equity into cash after the flood her house was worth less than the loan balance it left her in a terrible bind i am sitting here thinking that i am not going to be able to get out of this situation she said she eventually negotiated with the lender to offer the house as a short sale for 125 000 earlier this month ms archer closed on the sale and walked away for good now fearful of floods and the sound of hard rain she plans to move near a nephew in dallas where she will re enter the job market 10 years after her retirement there is no way i could have imagined i would be starting over at this point in my life she said then sighed deeply i know everything will be o k eventually staying homeon a fall afternoon as they were in the garage sorting the few salvageable pieces the roar of trucks carting debris in the distance mr swanson turned to ms swanson his wife of 24 years i don t want to leave do you he blurted out ms swanson shook her head neither did she for the swansons rebuilding was the only choice they knew it would be hard but this was home instead of returning to work mr swanson pitched in on the repairs for now ms swanson said it make more sense for jeff to be home helping with the house rather than to be on a job making 12 an hour the couple also bought flood insurance in october they received a fema grant for about 10 300 part of the more than 91 million the federal agency distributed in fort bend county they also received donated kitchen countertops and cabinets through a state program and a 25 000 grant from fort bend recovers a local public private disaster assistance coalition for construction costs there was still a gap but it was manageable and less than the cost of a new house and mortgage the numbers made sense but mr swanson said he also had a more personal reason for staying it took me this many years to finally become a texan he said harvey is not going to run us away stories in this series

florence n j nissa scott started working at the cavernous amazon warehouse in southern new jersey late last year stacking plastic bins the size of small ottomans it was not she says the most stimulating activity and lifting the bins which often weigh 25 pounds each was also tiring over 10 hour shifts now ms scott 21 watches her replacement a giant bright yellow mechanical arm do the stacking her new job at amazon is to babysit several robots at a time troubleshooting them when necessary and making sure they have bins to load on a recent afternoon a claw at end of the arm grabbed a bin off a conveyor belt and stacked it on another bin forming neat columns on wooden pallets surrounding the robot it was the first time amazon had shown the arm the latest generation of robots in use at its warehouses to a reporter for me it s the most mentally challenging thing we have here ms scott said of her new job it s not repetitive perhaps no company embodies the anxieties and hopes around automation better than amazon many people including president trump blame the company for destroying traditional retail jobs by enticing people to shop online at the same time the company s eye popping growth has turned it into a hiring machine with an unquenchable need for entry level warehouse workers to satisfy customer orders amazon s global work force is three times larger than microsoft s and 18 times larger than facebook s and last week amazon said it would open a second headquarters in north america with up to 50 000 new jobs complicating the equation even more amazon is also on the forefront of automation finding new ways of getting robots to do the work once handled by employees in 2014 the company began rolling out robots to its warehouses using machines originally developed by kiva systems a company amazon bought for 775 million two years earlier and renamed amazon robotics amazon now has more than 100 000 robots in action around the world and it has plans to add many more to the mix the robots make warehouse work less tedious and physically taxing while also enabling the kinds of efficiency gains that let a customer order dental floss after breakfast and receive it before dinner it s certainly true that amazon would not be able to operate at the costs they have and the costs they provide customers without this automation said martin ford a futurist and author of rise of the robots a book about automation maybe we wouldn t be getting two day shipping the dynamics between people and machines play out on a daily basis on the floor of amazon warehouses in places like florence n j and kent wash in kent the robots vaguely resemble giant beetles and scurry around with vertical shelves loaded with merchandise weighing up to 3 000 pounds on their backs hundreds of them move autonomously inside a large caged area tailgating each other but not colliding on one edge of the cage a group of human workers the stowers stuff products onto the shelves replenishing their inventory the robots whisk those shelves away and when a customer order arrives for products stored on their backs they queue up at stations on another edge of the cage like cars waiting to go through a toll both there human pickers follow instructions on computer screens grabbing items off the shelves and putting them in plastic bins which then disappear on conveyor belts destined for packers people who put the products in cardboard boxes bound for customers dave clark the top executive in charge of operations at amazon said the company wanted the machines to perform the most monotonous tasks leaving people to do jobs that engage them mentally it s a new item each time mr clark said you re finding something you re inspecting things you re engaging your mind in a way that i think is important the robots also cut down on the walking required of workers making amazon pickers more efficient and less tired the robots also allow amazon to pack shelves together like cars in rush hour traffic because they no longer need aisle space for humans the greater density of shelf space means more inventory under one roof which means better selection for customers the amazon warehouse in florence shows the latest example of the kinds of jobs machines can do better than people eight mechanical arms are in operation at the facility a warehouse where large quantities of merchandise are broken down into smaller units and distributed to amazon fulfillment centers across the country the arms go by the awkward name of robotic palletizers but workers have given them a dash of personality sticking signs on each one naming them after stuart dave and other minion characters from the despicable me movies unlike the warehouse robots in kent which were based on the machines amazon got through its kiva acquisition these arms come from an outside company amazon began installing them late last year not long after it opened the warehouse in florence the robot arm is configured to pick up only bins of a standard size not objects of other dimensions in a demonstration of future possibilities amazon showed a virtual reality simulation used to prototype new robot concepts including an arm with a forklift attachment that moved pallets when amazon installed the robots some people who had stacked bins before like ms scott took courses at the company to become robot operators many others moved to receiving stations where they manually sort big boxes of merchandise into bins no people were laid off when the robots were installed and amazon found new roles for the displaced workers mr clark said the people didn t go anywhere he said the question going forward is what happens when the future generations of robots arrive for now there are warehouse tasks for example picking individual items off shelves with all their various shapes and sizes where people outperform robots amazon has added 80 000 warehouse employees in the united states since adding the kiva robots for a total of more than 125 000 warehouse employees and it says the warehouse hiring spree will continue but start ups and researchers are scrambling to overcome the many remaining technical obstacles amazon even sponsors an annual contest to encourage more innovation in the category mr ford the author believes it is just a matter of time before the employment picture in amazon s warehouses changes my assumption is this technology will eventually displace a lot of people in those warehouses mr ford said i would not say that overnight huge numbers of jobs disappear maybe the first indication is they don t get rid of those people but the pace of job creation slows down amazon s mr clark said history showed that automation increases productivity and in some cases demand from consumers which ultimately creates more jobs he said warehouse workers would continue to work in technologically rich environments it s a myth that automation destroys net job growth he said in the case of the florence facility it opened up the new opportunity for ms scott at one point one of the arms knocked over a tote sending a dozen or so cone shaped plastic coffee filters skidding across the ground ms scott hit a button that froze the arm so she could safely pick up the mess then the arms started working again the robot will work the same all day long said edward cohoon who supervises ms scott and other amazon workers as they tend to individual robots their stomachs don t grumble follow nick wingfield on twitter working alongside robots in an amazon warehouse

thousands of con ed workers are angry at their washington based parent union for taking direct control of their 10 000 member local in july and ousting their popular leader who plans to renew calls to a federal judge this week to end the trusteeship more than 6 000 members of local 1 2 of the utility workers union of america have signed a petition protesting the decision to remove their leader joseph flaherty and put the union into trusteeship mr flaherty s supporters who say he was a forceful leader who had obtained improved pensions and unusual job security guarantees for them asserted that the president of the national union had engineered a crude power play to push aside an outspoken critic and potential challenger for the presidency i look at the folks from the national union as terrorists who took over the local for no reason whatsoever said harry farrell a trouble shooter on high voltage problems for con ed they know joe flaherty was a powerful union leader his integrity was impeccable in my 34 years in the union we never had a leader like joe flaherty but donald e wightman president of the parent union the 45 000 member utility workers union said the union took over its largest local and removed mr flaherty to rescue it from insolvency and from a leader who was stifling dissent and democracy mr wightman also said the local had wasted hundreds of thousands of dollars on excessive legal fees and a bloated payroll he said allegations that mr flaherty was being punished for his outspoken opposition were absolutely false mr flaherty had repeatedly accused mr wightman of violating federal law by accepting utility industry money to set up forums against deregulation of the electric industry both the union and the utilities fear deregulation will mean competition and layoffs but mr wightman said his lawyers advised him it was legal to use the money for that purpose for five months the two sides have furiously swapped charges and countercharges judge loretta a preska of federal district court in manhattan has been sifting through the conflicting accounts but so far has upheld the trusteeship this week mr flaherty plans to file new court papers asking the judge to reinstate him as the local s chief executive his formal title was business manager or to order a new election at the local since his ouster mr flaherty who had headed the local since 1991 has returned to his work in a manhole splicing cables regardless of who wins the court battle both sides agree that this has been an ugly painful episode not only for a respected union local but also for new york city s labor movement which has been scarred by a corruption scandal at district council 37 the giant municipal union the dispute has also hurt consolidated edison the utility negotiated a two year contract extension with james p keller the trustee running the local but mr flaherty turned the ratification vote into a referendum on the trusteeship and the extension was overwhelmingly defeated by a more than 2 to 1 margin last month mr wightman said he had acted courageously in removing mr flaherty if you put a local into trusteeship you re hated he said it s not the most popular thing to do whether the members knew it or not there was financial malpractice if i didn t act that local was as close to being insolvent as you can be mr wightman said that under mr flaherty the local s net assets fell to 1 million from 3 5 million and that he said was before mr flaherty projected a 500 000 deficit for last year mr wightman attacked mr flaherty for widespread excessive spending a 4 000 weekly retainer to the local s general counsel more than 2 million a year for wages and benefits for the local s 20 full time officers and more than 200 000 a year for leased cars and auto insurance mr wightman said it was wasteful to have 20 full time officers and he faulted mr flaherty for not reducing the union s staff when membership fell to 10 000 from 13 000 after reductions in the con ed work force because of automation he also attacked mr flaherty for paying legal fees with money from the fund meant to support members during a strike without first getting members approval the local was for all practical purposes bankrupt mr keller the trustee said unfortunately for years the members were informed only by what he told them mr flaherty acknowledged that the local s finances were in bad shape but he said that they were no worse than when he was elected as its leader the main reasons for the local s financial woes he said were the drop in membership and the million dollars a year in dues sent to the national union he said he acted frugally noting that he cut his salary to 95 000 from 100 000 and had officers give up leased luxury cars in favor of ford tauruses he insisted that the local s staff was smaller than when he took the local s helm mr flaherty said that when he had the bylaws amended to allow him to reduce the number of officers to save money the national union attacked him for trying to force out officers who disagreed with him this trusteeship is an outrage mr flaherty said it s purely political they could have trusteed me any time but they only did it after i criticized the national president if i was a good boy and kept my mouth shut i d still be there

recent weeks she hopes to be doing the same thing on real houses as summer starts caster davidson a 40 year old former autoworker is becoming adept at installing roof shingles plumbing and other building maintenance tasks she has been learning in a storefront classroom in recent weeks she hopes to be doing the same thing on real houses as summer starts ms davidson is participating in a retraining program operated by the general motors corporation and the united auto workers union that is designed to teach new skills to workers displaced most likely forever from the automobile assembly lines the pontiac program is a small part of the large retraining and job search effort that the union has negotiated with the big automobile companies starting in the dark days of the early 1980 s when tens of thousands of workers were laid off due to plunging car sales even though many workers have been rehired as the economy has improved no one expects employment in basic industries like automobiles and steel to reach the levels of the past the issue of retraining workers displaced from their factory jobs by technological change or automation or by competition from imports has become a national one according to a report issued last month by the senate republican conference more than a million workers are displaced each year these workers tend to lack the language and mathematical skills necessary for new jobs in high technology without retraining many of them will become part of a growing underclass increasingly made up of former industrial workers without the skills to remain in the workplace and of those without the skills to enter the senate report said the issue was addressed in the trade bill president reagan s veto of which is expected to be considered in the senate this week one section of the measure would provide 980 million for a new worker assistance program the program would roughly triple federal money available for retraining however the retraining provision has become subordinate to a part of the bill that would require employers to give workers 60 days notice of a plant closing the sad fact is that the 60 day notice has become the focus of the bill not the 1 billion for worker retraining said sar levitan a liberal labor economist who is professor of economics at george washington university and director of the university s center for social policy studies but in today s economy you have to be able to read and write and have communications skills to deal with customers in service jobs in the meantime some states have begun to look at the problem themselves in michigan whose state government contributes to the g m u a w program state officials this year announced the creation of a 100 million retraining program aimed at upgrading the technical skills of existing workers according to the department of labor retraining and assistance programs now reach less than 25 percent of displaced workers almost half of whom are forced to take lower paying jobs and the skill level employers demand is steadily rising according to some projections one third of the jobs created in the next 15 years will be filled by college graduates meanwhile unemployment nationally inched up to 5 5 percent the labor department announced last week notice of closingsadvance notice of plant closings is important in retraining efforts according to managers of the union general motors program if we can get to people early we will involve about 85 percent of them in our program said john furman a general motors executive attached to the u a w g m human resource center in auburn hills mich once they are laid off we only get 10 to 15 percent g m alone laid off more than 15 000 workers through plant closings in michigan last year the program is largely paid for by a company contribution of 15 cents for every hour worked by the automotive giant s union employees officials at the resource center say they have spent an average of 3 500 per worker in the program unions in less prosperous industries such as the united steel workers have had to rely almost completely on federal assistance a properly managed training program can ease the pain of a major plant closing or series of layoffs to both the employees and the community involved the family owned stroh brewery company caused a stir in detroit in 1985 when it announced plans to close its 71 year old downtown brewery idling about 1 200 people but indignation gave way to admiration when a company financed training and job placement program found work for all of the approximately 800 people who participated others retired or found jobs on their own identifying skills we found that many of these people were quite mechanically adept and had skills they did not realize said peter b inskeep director of personnel for stroh s we helped identify those skills and match them to available jobs the program cost the company about 1 5 million with another 600 000 from the state and federal governments the company feels it was money well spent both for the message it sent to its remaining employees and its overall reputation we got good press mr inskeep said a company stands to gain from that officials of the resource center say they provide training on two levels general job hunting skills such as how to respond to questions in an interview and training for specific jobs to avoid training workers for jobs that don t exist they line up the jobs first the program had ms davidson pounding shingles because the pontiac office found that building maintenance jobs are being steadily created as detroit s suburbs continue to grow we had 26 people when we started on feb 22 and we re down to eight now all the rest have jobs said alvin vicent the director of the program if that continues there will be no one left by june 30 when the program is set to end that s the way we want it to go mr vicent said

to america and the rest of the world the big football game tonight will be super bowl xxviii madison avenue though counts it as super bowl x that s because the 1994 super bowl in atlanta marks the xth er 10th anniversary of super sunday being as much an advertising event as it is a midwinter holiday viewers have learned they will be treated to at least a couple dozen extravagantly expensive lavishly promoted painstakingly produced commercials featuring new products sports and entertainment celebrities contests and other attention grabbing gimmicks how expensive production costs can run as high as 1 million add to that the cost of the air time a record 900 000 for each of the 56 30 second slots available at that stratospheric rate of 30 000 a second nbc which is broadcasting the game could take in 50 4 million it was not until super bowl xviii on jan 22 1984 that super sunday was transformed into an ad bowl during the third quarter of that game as the los angeles raiders were defeating the washington redskins 38 9 million households watched a commercial called 1984 in which apple computer introduced its macintosh computer from then on advertisers began looking at super bowl sunday as a showcase that was reinforced by two super bowl ad traditions that began in 1989 one was the creation of the bud bowl by anheuser busch and its agency d arcy masius benton bowles in which bottles of budweiser and bud light beers played in a make believe football game during the commercial breaks of the real one the other was the creation of the super bowl ad meter by usa today in which residents of a city a different one each year are invited to watch the game and rate the commercials for likability by using small hand held dial meters both will return for this evening s game anheuser busch and d m b b will stage bud bowl vi while the super bowl ad meter survey will be conducted in jacksonville fla what makes one super bowl spot succeed and another fail though it is difficult to generalize the best are generally surprising playful or both and make a memorable connection between the message and the product the clunkers on the other hand reek of self importance take themselves too seriously or just aren t funny after a decade of following super bowl advertising including the past three years as advertising columnist of the new york times i offer my list of the best and worst commercials in chronological order best 1 master lock company various commercials cramer krasselt 1974 93 master lock is a small advertiser that has devised a clever way of appearing big each year the company hobnobs with the likes of pepsi cola and mcdonald s by running a 30 second commercial during the super bowl the messages have changed over the years but the spots all end with with the same dramatic image a master lock padlock that still works after being pierced by a bullet its spot during today s super bowl presents familiar sites like the hoover dam and caesars palace that use master lock products for protection so powerful is the company s super bowl connection that many people think it spends its whole advertising budget on this one spot master lock does advertise elsewhere 2 apple computer 1984 chiat day 1984 even if 1984 which introduced the macintosh personal computer had not been instrumental in turning super bowl sunday into an advertising showcase it would be outstanding for its creative brilliance and strategic genius the 60 second spectacular which cost 400 000 to produce and ran only once was set in a giant auditorium where a menacing figure on a huge television screen evocative of big brother in the novel 1984 lectures an audience of blank faced drones a lithe young woman in athletic garb runs down the aisle and heaves a sledgehammer at the screen shattering it and unleashing a bright light by audaciously promising that macintosh would be why 1984 won t be like 1984 the commercial shrewdly linked apple to the forces of freedom and apple s rival i b m to big brotherism 3 anheuser busch bud bowls d arcy masius benton bowles 1989 93 commercials presenting mock football games between budweiser bud light and bud dry beers daffy to be sure but madison avenue has always delighted in anthropomorphic legerdemain as a gimmick from dancing cigarette packs to talking margarine tubs the commercials work because of a tongue in cheek tone gently spoofing sports and advertising cliches the annual match ups even copy the national football league conceit of using roman numerals the good natured humor prevails even as the puns grow more outrageous players named neon light budway joe the freezer and the beechwood backs who played for yeast texas state bud bowl vi today could be the last with current rosters next year a newcomer ice draft from budweiser will probably be unbottled sorry it s contagious 4 nike inc hare jordan wieden kennedy 1992 a frenetic 60 second commercial for nike s air jordan footwear teamed a live superstar michael jordan with an animated superstar bugs bunny with hilarious results air jordan joined forces with hare jordan to defeat four no goodniks in a nutty basketball game that paid homage to or liberally borrowed from the best gags of the classic warner brothers cartoons of the 1940 s best bit bugs dons women s clothing and a blond wig drawing appreciative wolf whistles from the bullies he holds up a sign silly aren t they a 90 second sequel aerospace jordan which ran during last year s super bowl was even more frantically paced many of the best gags could be enjoyed only by taping the commercial and repeatedly rerunning it 5 mcdonald s corporation showdown leo burnett u s a 1993 most of the mcdonald s advertising created by burnett is long on wholesome americana and short on deft humor but this spot for the nation s pre eminent fast feeder centering on a paul bunyanesque shootout between two basketball stars was uncharacteristically tongue in cheek and even a tad cheeky the 60 second commercial portrayed a can you top this basket shooting contest with a big mac as the prize between michael jordan and larry bird by the end the pair s ever more prodigious feats had led them to challenge each other at the top of the john hancock building in downtown chicago the spot scored the highest rating ever in the usa today ad meter a 9 0 and has inspired two sequels the first called split the uprights presented a football version of the superstars matchup with two n f l kickers chip lohmiller of the washington redskins and pete stoyanovich of the miami dolphins the second called one year later will appear this evening it features charles barkley in his mcdonald s commercial debut trying to wheedle his way into a rematch between mr jordan and mr bird worst 1 apple computer lemmings chiat day 1985 the success of apple s 1984 super bowl commercial was matched in reverse by the failure of its sequel a year later in lemmings which introduced apple s macintosh office line of office automation products executives mindlessly following each other over a cliff jumping because they would not question business as usual lemmings was as gloomy as 1984 with one crucial exception where 1984 turned positive at the end offering hope lemmings did not that spelled doom lemmings was such a disaster that it is cited as a reason chiat day lost the apple account to bbdo los angeles the following year and apple has never returned to advertising during a super bowl in effect retiring with a record of 1 1 2 burger king herb the nerd j walter thompson 1986 bomb dud flop disaster so much abuse to heap upon one nerd but all those harsh assessments and more were earned by a six week promotional campaign deemed one of the most notorious failures in marketing history the 40 million campaign centered on a search for herb the quintessential nerd described as the only person never to have been to a burger king the payoff came during the super bowl when burger king declared herb loves the whopper and promised he would visit a burger king in every state to give out prizes america s response huh if a nerd eats at burger king what does that say about me so sales went nowhere but the burger king account did leaving thompson a year later in one of the biggest switches in advertising history 3 coca cola diet coke promotion lintas new york 1991 in 1991 the persian gulf war overshadowed the cola wars forcing coca cola and pepsi cola to reassess plans to promote contests with humorous commercials coca cola went ahead with its contest but replaced its silly spots starring leslie nielsen as a bumbling police detective with serious spots including one announcing a 1 million donation to the u s o there have been few more surreal moments in advertising history than when a somber voiced announcer in a no frills diet coke commercial asked consumers to play the crack the code for real refreshment game pepsi by contrast scrapped its contest but stuck with its funny commercials featuring ray charles warbling you got the right one baby uh huh for diet pepsi the result diet pepsi trounced diet coke and coca cola has yet to return to the super bowl 4 reebok dan and dave commercials chiat day 1992 hubris in believing it could pre empt an entire olympic event was reebok s downfall the company kicked off a 30 million campaign pitting two americans dan o brien and dave johnson against each other in a self proclaimed duel to determine who was the world s greatest athlete the outcome the commercials rashly promised was to be settled in barcelona site of the 1992 summer games where one would win the gold medal in the decathlon the fates punished reebok three times first mr o brien failed to qualify for the olympic team second mr johnson won the bronze medal not the gold third a czech robert zmelik won the gold medal though he was a reebok endorser the company had not thought to mention him in its american advertisements 5 pepsi cola gotta have it commercials bbdo new york 1992 after years of declaring its flagship brand as the choice of a new generation in 1992 pepsi cola decided to dilute its longtime yen for youth by searching for a new slogan to reflect a multigenerational appeal the frantic celebrity crammed spots featured the likes of yogi berra regis philbin and leeza gibbons proclaiming that older folks can like pepsi too the new theme gotta have it but the theme was an artifact of the 1980 s promoting instant gratification and it strayed from pepsi s traditional strength of appealing to youthful consumers who fancy themselves unconventional a year later for the next super bowl gotta have it was supplanted by a more appropriate albeit ungainly slogan be young have fun drink pepsi photograph

the 1982 election california last of 10 articles appearing periodically on states with important gubernatorial races los angeles oct 26 californians are in the final days of a campaign that could result in the election of mayor tom bradley of los angeles as the first black governor in the united states but whether mr bradley a democrat or his republican opponent george deukmejian the state attorney general is elected governor on tuesday it appears that the victor will win along with the job the task of dealing with a rapidly growing budget deficit that state economists say could reach 500 million in this fiscal year which ends next june 30 the successor to gov edmund g brown jr who is a candidate for the united states senate in the same election will also have to deal with other problems rooted in fundamental economic ethnic and demographic changes in in california the ultimate impact of the changes can only be guessed now but they have already begun to affect the electoral process here and a consensus is growing that california is being transformed into a different place long postwar prosperityfor more than three decades after world war ii perhaps no state enjoyed the persistent prosperity and growth that california did between 1950 and 1980 its population increased almost 150 percent to 23 667 902 and it eclipsed new york as the country s most populous state lured by its pleasant climate a casual style of living and jobs millions of americans migrated here abetted by perhaps the best public system of higher education in the country california became a fertile ground for advanced technology in electronics and other industries and the new industries helped helped create thousands of jobs each year for the immigrants although many of the newcomers took jobs in aerospace and electronics growth itself was part of the economic engine creating millions of jobs in construction and service industries with the exception of a slump in 1968 when there was a sudden drop in employment at aerospace factories california missed the worst effects of most of the postwar recessions largely because it had developed a diversified industrial base population growth continued sporadically and it had relatively little reliance on the kind of basic industries that are hardest hit in a cyclical recession but in the most recent recession it has been battered and the state discovered that it was vulnerable after all home building hurt the worsthome building was hurt most of all but manufacturing agriculture logging mining and virtually every other sector of the economy were affected the security pacific national bank concluded recently in a report on the state economy with few exceptions the chill over california s industries during the past recession has been pervasive and in some cases devastating many analysts believe that once a solid national recovery is under way california led by aerospace and high technology industries that will benefit from increased national military spending will rebound at a faster rate than most other states but there is also concern that the state will face long term trouble in providing jobs for everyone who wants to live here from 1975 to 1979 the nine counties of southern california added new jobs at a rate of 5 5 percent annually the region still managed to add a few more jobs after the onset of the recession in 1980 and in 1981 but in the first half of this year it showed a net loss gain is less than 1 a yearaccording to the study by security pacific national bank california as a whole will have added 518 000 jobs reaching a total of 11 million in the five years from the end of 1978 through 1983 this would be a gain of 4 9 percent or less than 1 percent annually in the five years although even a small increase in a recession might indicate strength in the state s economy the bank noted that california s civilian labor force in the same period will have increased 9 3 percent or about one million workers thus the work force has been growing twice as fast as the number of jobs and the state s unemployment rate in august was 10 3 percent facts that help explain why both mr bradley and mr deukmejian have made assertions about creating more jobs the focus of their campaigns although many problems in the most recent recession have been linked to the national recession some economists detect basic changes in the state s economy that have troubling implications no matter who succeeds mr brown loss of 105 000 jobs in closingsaccording to a state legislative committee 979 manufacturing plants were closed permanently from jan 1 1980 to july 31 1982 bringing the loss of more than 105 000 jobs including 38 000 in los angeles county among the major causes the analysts found were erosion of markets by foreign competitors obsolescence of plants built in the postwar boom effects of automation and changing patterns of distribution and manufacturing that led to consolidation of plants and the closing of some facilities as inefficient the cost of housing in california where the average home runs 50 percent above the national average has been cited as a major factor in the loss of jobs the closely watched california poll operated by mervin d field reported last week that voters said that the most important problem facing the state after inflation was the need for jobs jobs a principal focusbesides being a principal focus in the gubernatorial race between mr bradley and mr deukmejian the jobs issue has been one of the main points of contention between mr brown a democrat who takes credit for having helped generate more than 500 000 jobs in his eight years as governor and mayor pete wilson of san diego his republican rival for the senate mayor wilson has accused mr brown of running an antibusiness administration that caused an exodus of employers from the state and mr brown s stewardship of the state while governor has become a major thrust of the wilson campaign for all of its recent problems with the closing of manufacturing plants many economists predict that california s economy will grow faster than the nation s in the 1980 s although some are skeptical that it will be able to sustain its former high rate of growth for long whether california reclaims its former role as a land of opportunity demographic experts say it is inevitable that people will continue to come here in search of jobs but they say that relatively fewer are likely to be from the united states and more will come from foreign countries the state s future they say will be partly shaped by sweeping changes in its ethnic composition in the 1970 s california took in millions of immigrants from latin america asia and elsewhere in a tide of immigration that was comparable to the great flood of migrants from europe to the eastern seaboard at the turn of the century school pattern reversedthe immigration is already having wide effects on the state from a reversal in the last two years of a decade old decline in enrollment in the los angeles school system to the emergence of enclaves of immigrants from mexico korea el salvador taiwan and other countries in some cities there is a growing if still tentative demand by mexican and asian immigrants for a bigger role in the governing of the state in the mid 1970 s population studies indicated that california historically a magnet for immigrants from other states was nearing a milestone a point when more than half of the residents would be california born immigration from other states leveled off in the later part of the decade and the state s large population of native young people was expected to tip the balance but largely because of heavy foreign migration especially from mexico the trend was reversed the 1980 census showed that 55 percent of californians were born outside the state and almost 20 percent were born outside the country in a study published last week a private research group the center for continuing study of the california predicted that the trend would accelerate in the 80 s it estimated that the state s minority population now about 33 percent would approach 45 percent by the year 2000 rise in hispanic populationit forecast that the number of californians of hispanic descent 4 5 million in 1980 would increase more than 70 percent in the decade to a total of at least 7 7 million and possibly as many as 7 9 million it said the proportion of people of hispanic origin now 20 percent could climb to 28 percent and the proportion of asians now 6 7 percent might reach 10 percent the study concluded that the proportion of blacks now 7 5 percent could remain level or decline slightly the number of californians of mexican descent almost doubled in the decade and in los angeles county now accounts for nearly 30 percent of the total largely because of immigration from mexico los angeles was among only a handful of major cities that experienced population increases in the decade as a result of reapportionment california has two additional seats in the house of representatives at stake this year and hispanic leaders say they are hopeful of winning at least one of them tuesday the combination of providing public services to accommodate the accelerating immigration the slower rate at which jobs are being created and the squeeze on state and local government imposed by various tax cutting programs in the state will be among the problems facing the winner of tuesday s gubnernatorial election last spring the state legislature and mr brown anxious to avoid an election year tax increase collaborated to produce a precariously balanced 25 2 billion budget ken cory the state controller says that the budget is already far out of balance california at a glance geography california s 158 693 square miles make it the country s largest state after alaska and texas its coastline stretches 780 miles from the mexican border to oregon and for much of it california is 350 miles wide history spanish conquerors came to california in the 16th century but not until 200 years later did spain establish permanent settlements as far north as san francisco only to be ejected by the mexican revolution of 1821 twenty five years later the united states seized california in the mexican war the gold rush of 1849 led to the admission of california to the union as the 31st state in 1850 population expanded rapidly from 1890 to 1970 it doubled every two decades economy if california were a nation it would be the world s seventh largest in terms of gross national product leading the other 49 states in economic and total personal income california has the lartgest labor force in the country agriculture because of extensive irrigation over the last century is the mainstay but manufacturing has been a major force since 1900 the motion picture boom started in the 1920 s defense plants came with world war ii and developed into today s aerospace and high technology industries population california has been the country s most populous state since 1963 the 1980 census listed 23 667 902 residents more than half of them live in suburban communities and more than third in central cities los angeles county is the state s largest metropolitan area with 7 477 657 people but its population has risen only 6 percent since 1970 mexican americans and others of spanish origin now constitute 20 percent of californians 7 5 percent are black and 6 7 percent are asian politics in seven of the last eight presidential elections the

aside from its environmental benefits solar energy is frequently touted for its job creation potential but for solar manufacturers themselves machines not employees may be the key to their long term survival take for example photovoltaic solar panels the most common form of solar technology as roger efird the managing director of the united states branch of suntech power a solar energy company based in china explained the process of making these cells is already largely automated but he added the process of taking the individual solar cells and connecting them to create a solar panel is sometimes done by machines and sometimes by hand depending on the company and the factory according to jesse pichel a clean tech analyst at piper jaffray companies in developing countries including china typically rely on workers to perform this task because human labor is frequently cheaper than automation technology to stay competitive therefore manufacturers in europe japan and the united states where labor costs are significantly higher will need to employ more automation technology and mr efird the suntech director pointed out that labor costs will eventually increase in china too if suntech wants to expand into developing markets he said they will also need to build factories that employ more automated technologies of course industry analysts and manufacturers say solar power still holds significant promise for job creation though mostly on the installation and maintenance side of things and mr efird and others suggested that like the heating and air conditioning contractors solar installation and maintenance jobs are more durable in the long run you cannot export those jobs he said its local people doing local work in local communities

u s urged to lower oil imports study calls cuts crucial to wests economic plans by paul lewis special to the new yot k times basel switzerland june il the western worlds plans for aiding economic growth and cutting unemployment which dominate the agenda for next months bonn economic summit meeting will fail unless the united states takes drastic action to reduce its oil imports and other countries intensify their energy saving efforts the bank for international settlements warned in its latest annual report but according to the report which was made public today even if the western industrial countries succeed in conserving energy the stimulative measures for the world economy that president carter and other western leaders hope to work out may only temper a recession that seems rooted in deep seated problems such maladjustments suggest the possibility of a slowdown of the kon dratieff type after several decades of virtually uninterrupted growth the report argues referring to the soviet economist nikolai kondratieff who contended that western economies move roughly in 50 year cycles of expansion and contraction that cannot easily be reversed top central bank the bank tor international settlements often known as the central bankers central bank is headquartered here and acts as a clearing house for international payments owed by the major central banks of the industrial world the b i s annual report which always reflects the conservative instincts of its owners still manages to be one of the most provocative and most interestingly written reports on the world economic outlook published by any international institution this year the b i s gives its full support to the western industrial nations plans for trying to end the world recession through a coordinated reflation of their economies together with steps to free trade and promote currency stability president carter will discuss these ideas with the political leaders of europe canada and japan at their economic summit meeting in bonn on july 15 the potential consequences of near stagnation are sufficently dangerous to warrent a concerted international effort to put the world economy back on a more satifsetory path of development the latest report says pavments balance a concern but without fresh steps to reduce the west s dependence on imported oil the b i s argues that these plans are likely to be self defeating faster economic growth in the industrial world will just suck in more foreign oil increasing the large balance of payments surplus the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries already enjoy its report says this opec surplus is already depressing economic activity in the oilimporting countries by saddling them with a payments deficit they cannot continued on page d3 reducing world oil use called key to recovery continued from page di shake off according to the report if it gets any bigger the b i s fears any recovery in the world economy will prove short lived in the event of a more satisfactory growth in the world economy the oil surplus could well increase again a prospect that itself makes the event unlikely the b i s says only further economies in the use of oil could provide an escape from this dilemma the b i s report continues asking rhetorically will those industrial countries which have already proved sucessful in saving oil be able to keep up this trend and will the united states which has been the least successful among the major industrial countries in achieving a substantial reduction in the use of oil per unit of gross national productbe able to follow the example set by other countries surplus reduction cited the b i s welcomes the recent reduction in opec s payments surplus which fell from sdo billion in 1976 to 34 billion last year and is still on a declining trend but it notes that the rate of reduction is tending to slacken as the scarcely populated oil exporting countries like saudi arabia and the gulf emirates find they cannot spend their revenues on imports while the total value of their oil exports is now increasing while the b i s sees energy conservation as essential for any lasting economic recovery in the west it also says the industrial world is unlikely to return quickly to the high rates of growth it enjoyed during the 20 years immediately following world war ii the b i s cites several structural obstacles to full recovery which it thinks may mean the west is caught in the downward phase of the so called long wave first described by kon dratieff in the 1920s these include the tendency for western countries to consume more and invest less than in the past the growing challenge many of their industries like steel and shipbuilding now face from low cost rivals in the developing world and signs that new inventions now tend to destroy jobs instead of creatine them new kind of technology even the nature of technological innovations which now tend towards automation and labor saving appears to be basically different from the kind of innovation which in the past gave birth to investment booms in the electricity motor vehicle or petrochemical industries the b i s report said although the b i s feels the evidence of a kondratieff type downswing is not yet conclusive it says it is not implausible that countries have shifted to a lower trend of growth rate and it warns warns governments against aiming at growth rates compatible with thoseof the i960 in its usual survey of world financial markets the b i s takes an implicitly bullish view of the outlook for gold it points out that demand remained strong in 1977 and early 1978 although the communist countries sold 450 tons their largest sales since 1965 paying for imports these sales are believed to reflect the increasing difficulty communist countries are experiencing in raising western currencies to pay for their imports the b i s reports that international bank lending last year rose by about 75 billion to 405 billion about the same rate of increase as the year before when allowance is made for the rising dollar value of loans made in west german marks swiss francs and japanese yen

lead a couple of weeks ago i read in the newspaper that the 11 lighthouses in the united states that are still tended by keepers will be automated by the fall of 1989 well i thought there goes the last symbol there ll be no more to the lighthouse just as there ll be no more don quixote because the windmills too are gone a couple of weeks ago i read in the newspaper that the 11 lighthouses in the united states that are still tended by keepers will be automated by the fall of 1989 well i thought there goes the last symbol there ll be no more to the lighthouse just as there ll be no more don quixote because the windmills too are gone no more moby dick now that the whaling ships are automated can someone write a lyrical novel called to the computer the coast guard estimates that since the automation of america s 445 lighthouses was begun in 1968 it has saved 25 million but what is 25 million compared with the value of a symbol certainly we have more millions than symbols with one hand our country gives hundreds of millions to the arts and with the other hand it takes our symbols away to save a paltry sum but is it really to save money that they re removing the keepers is anything ever done now for the sake of economy or is it that the modern mind simply mistrusts symbols it s too picturesque isn t it to think of people in stone towers on lonely spits of land gazing out over the ocean mrs ramsay the heroine of to the lighthouse would have to think of something else to do she d have to send her children on an outward bound course a mother of eight mrs ramsay saw the lighthouse as an outpost of her maternal surveillance a night light in the nursery of the world her 6 year old son james had a passion for going to the lighthouse she planned to take him but his father the philosopher the logical man predicted that the weather would not permit it just as the weather of our time will not permit people to live in lighthouses in his heart mr ramsay may have been jealous of the lighthouse just as science is jealous of the human element he believed that he was the lighthouse he kept watch over the world yet he had a terrible insufficiency a great need for the human touch mrs ramsay was the keeper of his light and without her it would surely have dimmed he was always turning to her in a most unscientific way for support take this sentence for example mrs ramsay who had been sitting loosely folding her son in her arms braced herself and half turning seemed to raise herself with an effort and at once to pour erect into the air a rain of energy a column of spray looking at the same time animated and alive as if all her energies were being fused into force burning and illuminating quietly though she sat taking up her stocking again and into this delicious fecundity this fountain and spray of life the fatal sterility of the male plunged itself like a beak of brass barren and bare a sentence like that is worth 25 million any day and mrs ramsay how can we estimate her value if the commander of the coast guard had read to the lighthouse would he have kept the keepers the new plan is for the vacated houses to be made into bed and breakfast inns or museums in the contemporary world everything turns into something else it s all a masquerade i have a suggestion i think the coast guard should make one of those buildings into a virginia woolf museum and then put a copy of to the lighthouse on a table beside the beds in all the inns now with pierre petitfils definitive biography of rimbaud we know all about the poet who said i is somebody else who said a language must be found and one must be absolutely modern we have all the retrievable facts about the man or boy for he was only a teen ager at the time who proposed an alchemy of words and colors for the vowels who called the poet a thief of fire yet as w s merwin pointed out in his review of mr petitfils book in these pages the poet escapes the facts we have to imagine him to invent him for ourselves on the basis of the poems and the letters we have to look for him between the lines of the anecdotes in the famous painting by fantin latour of the vilains bonshommes the bad boys of poetry rimbaud looks seductive and willful he is beautiful and talented and like a revolutionary poet he uses his beauty and his talent aggressively remorselessly perhaps the only crack in the hard surface of his modernity is his love affair with paul verlaine whose work is just as good but less spectacular more conventional verlaine too is in the fantin latour painting but he looks sad though he is only 10 years older than rimbaud he appears worn his remarkably bulgy forehead is swollen with the effort of poetry the seduction of the modern of the systematized disorganization of all the senses as rimbaud put it is all too familiar yet it s hard to live with as we know from rimbaud s relations with other people he and verlaine the two greatest poets of their age spent more time quarreling than loving even in poetry a steady diet of rebellion grates on the nerves verlaine wrote careful musical poems and rimbaud must sometimes have tried his patience i can imagine them in a paris cafe where they used to drink absinthe rimbaud is repeating something he has already said in a letter to a friend this language will be of the soul for the soul and will include everything verlaine makes a little grimace it is not clear whether it is the absinthe or rimbaud s pronunciamento that causes it one can t include everything everything is already there enormity becoming norm rimbaud says let us ask the poet for something new by all means dear boy verlaine says ask away rimbaud begins to chant the colors of the vowels black a white e red i green u blue o please verlaine says not your a b c s again he pauses debates with himself comes to a decision you know rimb it s all right for you to say these things they have a certain chic but you mustn t believe them he tousles rimbaud s hair but the younger man pulls away after all the declarations verlaine says after all the revolutions we have to pull down the barricades and put the cobblestones back in the streets we must return to the normal allow traffic to flow life to go on you see dear boy verlaine says when all is said and done poetry is not so much a thief of fire or a disorganization of the senses as it is a matter of hard work of intelligence taste observation of the world and suffering don t forget suffering of course it s fun to disorganize the senses it s like getting drunk or making love but then you have to reorganize them again there s the pain of coming back like the wearing off of the anesthesia after an operation verlaine shot rimbaud with a pistol after one of their quarrels inflicting a superficial wound on his wrist a slap on the wrist so to speak for which he served a prison sentence while it s generally supposed that verlaine did this out of sexual jealousy and possessiveness i like to think he shot rimbaud for the sake of poetry he shot him to show that poetry is serious that as wallace stevens said it can kill a man 


Document 16 :

ann arbor mich jessica schairer has so much in common with her boss chris faulkner that a visitor to the day care center they run might get them confused they are both friendly white women from modest midwestern backgrounds who left for college with conventional hopes of marriage motherhood and career they both have children in elementary school they pass their days in similar ways juggling toddlers coaching teachers and swapping small secrets that mark them as friends they even got tattoos together though ms faulkner as the boss earns more money the difference is a gap not a chasm but a friendship that evokes parity by day becomes a study of inequality at night and a testament to the way family structure deepens class divides ms faulkner is married and living on two paychecks while ms schairer is raising her children by herself that gives the faulkner family a profound advantage in income and nurturing time and makes their children statistically more likely to finish college find good jobs and form stable marriages ms faulkner goes home to a trim subdivision and weekends crowded with children s events ms schairer s rent consumes more than half her income and she scrapes by on food stamps i see chris s kids they re in swimming and karate and baseball and boy scouts and it seems like it s always her or her husband who s able to make it there ms schairer said that s something i wish i could do for my kids but number one that stuff costs a lot of money and two i just don t have the time the economic storms of recent years have raised concerns about growing inequality and questions about a core national faith that even americans of humble backgrounds have a good chance of getting ahead most of the discussion has focused on labor market forces like falling blue collar wages and lavish wall street pay but striking changes in family structure have also broadened income gaps and posed new barriers to upward mobility college educated americans like the faulkners are increasingly likely to marry one another compounding their growing advantages in pay less educated women like ms schairer who left college without finishing her degree are growing less likely to marry at all raising children on pinched paychecks that come in ones not twos estimates vary widely but scholars have said that changes in marriage patterns as opposed to changes in individual earnings may account for as much as 40 percent of the growth in certain measures of inequality long a nation of economic extremes the united states is also becoming a society of family haves and family have nots with marriage and its rewards evermore confined to the fortunate classes it is the privileged americans who are marrying and marrying helps them stay privileged said andrew cherlin a sociologist at johns hopkins university about 41 percent of births in the united states occur outside marriage up sharply from 17 percent three decades ago but equally sharp are the educational divides according to an analysis by child trends a washington research group less than 10 percent of the births to college educated women occur outside marriage while for women with high school degrees or less the figure is nearly 60 percent long concentrated among minorities motherhood outside marriage now varies by class about as much as it does by race it is growing fastest in the lower reaches of the white middle class among women like ms schairer who have some postsecondary schooling but no four year degree while many children of single mothers flourish two of the last three presidents had mothers who were single during part of their childhood a large body of research shows that they are more likely than similar children with married parents to experience childhood poverty act up in class become teenage parents and drop out of school sara mclanahan a princeton sociologist warns that family structure increasingly consigns children to diverging destinies married couples are having children later than they used to divorcing less and investing heavily in parenting time by contrast a growing share of single mothers have never married and many have children with more than one man the people with more education tend to have stable family structures with committed involved fathers ms mclanahan said the people with less education are more likely to have complex unstable situations involving men who come and go she said i think this process is creating greater gaps in these children s life chances ms schairer s life offers a vivid example of how rapidly norms have changed she grew up in a small town outside ann arbor where her life revolved around church and school and everyone she knew was married i thought i ll meet someone and we ll marry and have kids and the house and the white picket fence she said that s what i wanted that s what i still want she got pregnant during her first year of college left school and stayed in a troubled relationship that left her with three children when it finally collapsed six years ago she has had little contact with the children s father and receives no child support with an annual income of just under 25 000 ms schairer barely lifts her children out of poverty but she is not one to complain i m in this position because of decisions i made she said she buys generic cereal at about half the brand name price takes the children to church every week and posts their happy moments on her facebook page inequality is a word she rarely uses though her family life is a showcase of its broadening reach two incomes would certainly help with the bills she said but it s parenting too i wish i could say call your dad path to single motherhoodthe van with the cracked windshield arrived on a recent day at 7 30 a m and three people emerged the smallest stifling yawns several days a week ms schairer opens the child care center 45 minutes before she can send her two youngest children to school bored children in work spaces make mornings tense savannah 7 crossed the play area on stilts steavon 10 threw a ball as parents with infants and toddlers hurried past ms schairer chided the two to stay out of the way they re really not supposed to be here she said steavon has asperger syndrome a mild form of autism that can lead to sharp mood swings he slumped on her desk wanting 2 to buy a bagel at school ms schairer does not carry cash one way not to spend it and handed him pretzels from home i don t like those he said shoving them away ms schairer is known for a spotless desk steavon found a leaky pen i m ready for you to go she said time away is money lost ms schairer punched a clock by the door so she hurried the children to school and returned with a look of relief a stop in ms faulkner s office brought a bit of rejuvenating gossip two teachers were having a tiff adult diversions are absent at home i talk to myself a lot ms schairer said although she grew up in the 1990s ms schairer s small town childhood had a 1950s feel her father drove a beer truck her mother served as church trustee and her grandparents lived next door she knew no one rich no one poor and no one raising children outside of marriage it was just the way it was she said william penn university eight hours away in iowa offered a taste of independence and a spot on the basketball team her first thought when she got pregnant was my mother s going to kill me abortion crossed her mind but her boyfriend an african american student from arkansas said they should start a family they agreed that marriage should wait until they could afford a big reception and a long gown their odds were not particularly good nearly half the unmarried parents living together at a child s birth split up within five years according to child trends ms schairer has trouble explaining even to herself why she stayed so long with a man who she said earned little berated her often and did no parenting they lived with family his and hers and worked off and on while she hoped things would change i wanted him to love me she said she was 25 when the breakup made it official she was raising three children on her own she had just answered an ad from a child care center that needed a teacher s assistant ms faulkner hired her and promoted her twice most recently to assistant director she was always stepping out of the classroom and helping ms faulkner said she just had that drive that leader in her i trust her completely ms schairer took night classes and earned a degree from washtenaw community college a supervisor from the corporate office wrote we are so lucky to have you still after nearly six years she remains an hourly employee making 12 35 an hour simultaneously in management and on food stamps after ms schairer had an operation for cervical cancer last summer the surgeon told her to take six weeks off she went back to work five weeks early with a rare flash of class anger it s easy when you make 500 an hour to stand there and tell me to take six weeks off she said i can t have six weeks with no pay a broadening gapdespite the egalitarian trappings of her youth ms schairer was born in 1981 as a tidal surge of inequality was remaking american life incomes at the top soared progress in the middle stalled and the paychecks of the poor fell sharply four decades ago households with children at the 90th percentile of incomes received five times as much as those at the 10th percentile according to bruce western and tracey shollenberger of the harvard sociology department now they have 10 times as much the gaps have widened even more higher up the income scale the reasons are manifold the growing premium a college education commands technological change that favors mind over muscle the growth of the financial sector the loss of manufacturing jobs to automation and foreign competitors and the decline of labor unions but marriage also shapes the story in complex ways economic woes speed marital decline as women see fewer marriageable men the opposite also holds true marital decline compounds economic woes since it leaves the needy to struggle alone the people who need to stick together for economic reasons don t said christopher jencks a harvard sociologist and the people who least need to stick together do changes in family structure do not explain the gains of the very rich the much discussed 1 percent and the richest among them that story largely spills from wall street trading floors and corporate boardrooms but for inequality more broadly mr western found that the growth in single parenthood in recent decades accounted for 15 percent to 25 percent of the widening income gaps estimates depend on the time period the income tiers and the definition of inequality gary burtless of the brookings institution found it to account for 21 percent robert lerman of the urban institute comparing lower middle and upper middle income families found that single parenthood explained about 40 percent of inequality s growth that s not peanuts he said across middle america single motherhood has moved from an anomaly to a norm with head turning speed that change received a burst of attention this year with the publication of charles murray s new book coming apart the state of white america 1960 2010 which attributed the decline of marriage to the erosion of values rather than the decline of economic opportunity as recently as 1990 just 10 percent of the births to women like ms schairer white women with some postsecondary schooling but not a full college degree occurred outside marriage according to child trends now it has tripled to 30 percent compared with just 8 percent for women of all races with college degrees less educated women are also more likely to have children with more than one man analyzing nearly 2 000 mothers in their mid to late 20s child trends found that a third of those with high school degrees or less already had children with multiple men so did 12 percent of mothers with some post high school training but none of the women in the study who had finished college before giving birth had children with multiple men that s a dramatic difference and it varies by education more than by race said mindy scott a child trends demographer it tells you these families are on different trajectories having men in the house for a short time with ambiguous parenting roles can be really disruptive for children ms schairer did not have a child with another man but she did find a new boyfriend who she thought would help with the children and the bills they dated for a year before he moved in kirsten 11 and savannah liked him fine but steavon adored him i m not the only boy anymore we re going to do boy stuff ms schairer recounts him saying what s boy stuff she asked we re going to play video games and shoot nerf guns and play legos he said we do that now she said yeah but you re not a boy he said the details of what followed are less important than the disappointment the boyfriend left behind no legos got built during his six month stay and it took a call to the police to get him to go the children asked about him a few days later but have not mentioned him since whether measured by legos or marriage rates the pattern is similar the middle is shifting toward the bottom forty years ago the top and middle income thirds had virtually identical family patterns more than 95 percent of households with children in either tier had two parents in the home since then the groups have diverged according to mr western and ms shollenberger 88 percent at the top have two parents but just 71 percent do in the middle things remained extremely stable in the top third mr western said the middle is increasingly suffering some of the same disadvantages as the bottom that is the essence of the story of ms faulkner and ms schairer what most separates them is not the impact of globalization on their wages but a 6 foot 8 inch man named kevin school trips and scoutingkevin faulkner works the sunrise shift twice a week leaving home at 5 30 a m for a computer programming job so he can leave work in time to take his sons to afternoon swim practice jeremy 12 is serious and quiet justin 10 is less driven but more openly affectionate they arrived home recently to a note from ms faulkner about the next day s boy scout trip thursday night packkevin pay home depotchris sort clothesthe couple s life together has unfolded in to do list style they did not inherit wealth or connections or rise on rare talent they just did standard things in standard order high school college job marriage and children i don t think i could have done it any more by the books ms faulkner said the result is a three bedroom house two busy boys and an annual disney cruise the secret to their success resides in part in old fashioned math strength in numbers together the faulkners earn nearly three times as much as what ms faulkner earns alone their high five figure income ranks them near the 75th percentile hardly rich but better off than nearly three of four families with children for ms schairer the logic works in reverse her individual income of 24 500 puts her at the 49th percentile among parents smack in the middle but with only one paycheck her family income falls to the 19th percentile lagging more than four out of five the faulkners built a house in livingston county because of the good schools ms schairer cares about education too but with ann arbor rents wreaking havoc on her budget she is considering a move to a neighboring town where the school system lags she shops at discount grocery stores and tells savannah to keep away a friend who raids the cabinets i feel bad like maybe she s not getting enough to eat ms schairer said but sometimes i don t know what i m going to feed my own kids never mind another jeremy faulkner plays tennis and takes karate justin plays soccer and baseball they both swim and participate in boy scouts including a weeklong summer camp that brings the annual activities bill to about 3 500 boy scouts has been especially important offering the boys leadership opportunities and time with their father who helps manage the troop and rarely misses a weekly meeting or monthly camping trip jeremy started as a shy boy terrified of public speaking now he leads the singalong and is racing to make eagle scout he s just blossomed through boy scouts ms faulkner said i could do the scouting with them because we have single moms who play that role but they have different experiences with their dad kevin makes good money but he s an awesome dad ms schairer tells an opposite story constraints in time and money limit her children to one sports season a year that compounds steavon s isolation she said and reduces her chances to network on his behalf when she invited his classmates to a park on his birthday a few months ago no one came he cried and cried and cried she said i tried the parents i had numbers for but they didn t respond researchers have found that extracurricular activities can enhance academic performance and scholars cite a growing activities gap to help explain why affluent children tend to do so much better than others in school four decades ago families in the top income fifth spent about four times as much as those at the bottom fifth on things like sports music and private schools according to research by greg j duncan of the university of california irvine and richard j murnane of harvard now affluent families spend seven times as much two parents also bring two parenting perspectives ms faulkner does bedtime talks mr faulkner does math when ms faulkner s coaxing failed to persuade jeremy to try hamburgers mr faulkner offered to jump in a pool fully clothed if he took a bite an offer jeremy found too tempting to refuse while many studies have found that children of single parents are more likely to grow up poor less is known about their chances of advancement as adults but there are suggestions that the absence of a father in the house makes it harder for children to climb the economic ladder scott winship of the brookings institution examined the class trajectories of 2 400 americans now in their mid 20s among those raised in the poorest third as teenagers 58 percent living with two parents moved up to a higher level as adults compared with just 44 percent of those with an absent parent a parallel story played out at the top just 15 percent of teenagers living with two parents fell to the bottom third compared with 27 percent of teenagers without both parents you re more likely to rise out of the bottom if you live with two parents and you re less likely to fall out of the top mr winship said mr winship interprets his own results cautiously warning that other differences like race education or parenting styles may also separate the two groups and even if marriage helped the people who got married he warns it might hurt other families if it tied them to troubled men you get back to the question of how many marriageable men there are he said at the same time scholars have found that marriage itself can have a motivating effect pushing men to earn more than unmarried peers marriage that is can help make men marriageable as mr faulkner tells it something like that happened to him he returned to college after an aimless hiatus because he wanted to marry ms faulkner i knew i had to get serious about my life he said his experiences as a father so far suggest just how much there is to be said for simply showing up thank you for coming dad justin wrote after a school trip i like it when you re with me at every event and watching me do every activity he added 16 exclamation points end of the dayleft to do the showing up alone ms schairer makes big efforts she rarely misses a weekend of church with the children and she sacrificed a day s pay this spring to chaperon field day at steavon and savannah s school they were both saying this is my mom my mom is here she said in february she received 7 000 of refundable tax credits the low wage worker s annual bonus she prepaid her rent for six months and bought plane tickets to orlando fla after years of seeing pictures of ms faulkner s vacations she wanted to give her children one of their own do you think we ll see jesus savannah asked on the flight i hope the plane doesn t run him over they stayed with ms schairer s brother visited seaworld and gatorland and brought back happy memories but the trip soon began to seem long ago more a break from their life than an embodiment of it ms schairer sank into the couch on a recent friday night looking weary and half watched a rerun of friends steavon retreated to his room to watch superman alone and savannah went out to play with the girl who always seems hungry kirsten was in her pajamas at 7 o clock they had few weekend plans thirty miles away troop 395 was pitching tents beside a rural airstrip where the next day the boys would take glider rides and earn aviation badges the fields and barns looked as tidy as cartoons and

started to boast mr faulkner snapped on his tug of war gloves only to discover that justin had disappeared he found him sitting in the grass nearby fighting back tears i want to go home justin said mr faulkner did not say much jeremy used to get homesick too now he is halfway to eagle scout after a while mr faulkner asked are you sure you don t want to do a tug of war against me justin watched the other boys tumble when he said we can do it right now mr faulkner said it was not much of a contest for a man who outweighs his two sons combined by more than 100 pounds justin fell face first and

colleges and universities used to be structurally unemployed in the nation s unemployment problems confining their interest to studies in the classroom but no more prompted by record unemployment rates of 30 percent or more in some parts of the nation an increasing number of them are providing tuition for the jobless retraining for the hard core unemployed and aid to governmental agencies civic groups and unions in finding new positions for blue collar workers as well as professionals more colleges are attacking the problem of unemployment today because they realize that there is no job security anymore said vilma allen director of continuing education at fairfield university in connecticut which set up one of the first programs in the nation to help the unemployed assembly line workers in auto plants as well as executives of multinational corporations are losing their jobs because so many industries and occupations are being changed or eliminated recent studies by the federal bureau of labor statistics support mrs allen s observation in 1981 23 4 million americans or about one of five workers were unemployed at some time or other during the year last year more than one of every three skilled workers had been laid off social statisticians such as dr marcus felson of the university of illinois say changes in enrollment have made schools more aware of the problems of the jobless colleges and universities are becoming increasingly dependent upon adults rather than 18 to 22 year olds to fill their classrooms because the baby boom is over he said higher education also recognizes that it has to do something to alleviate unemployment because its future depends upon it if people don t have jobs then they aren t going to be able to support colleges and universities the experience of fairfield university is typical of the approach adopted by many schools in aiding the jobless fairfield which has long offered its students and graduates help in finding summer or permanent jobs decided in 1981 to offer a special workshop in career development for unemployed teachers in its area besides demonstrating to the teachers how to find new positions through professional groups how to write resumes and how to answer difficult questions at interviews the counselors show them how the skills they had acquired in education could qualify them for jobs in advertising data processing and other white collar fields one of the biggest problems in working with the unemployed is overcoming their tendency to restrict themselves to looking for the same kinds of jobs they had before said mrs allen by getting them to analyze their interest needs and priorities we encourge them to start thinking about jobs and occupations they never considered before other colleges are offering programs for persons who have a long history of unemployment and little formal education many of these programs include remedial education in english and mathematics as well as instruction in a trade in which there is a shortage of qualified workers new york city technical college for example trains about 180 men and women each year to pass a ninth grade qualifying test in english for clerical positions the college which is part of the city university of new york also has training programs for men and women who want to work as personal care assistants for the elderly or shutins and a training program for women who want to enter nontraditional jobs in building maintenance or the repair of heating and airconditioning systems massachusetts is addressing the problem of unemployment by offering free tuition at its 24 publicly supported colleges and universities about 1 000 people have taken advantage of the plan that allows them to take up to 15 credits each semester if they have exhausted their unemployment benefits or 11 if they are still receiving funds the board of regents allocated 1 million this spring and expects to continue the program next year the typical student according to gary d sullivan special assistant to the massachusetts chancellor of higher education is a 35 year old who enrolls in a community college to study computer technology or a business course that will have an immediate payoff in a job few students he said have enrolled in liberal arts courses at the state university other colleges and universities are starting to follow massachusetts s example passaic county community college in paterson n j will waive tuition for the jobless this summer under its plan unemployed residents will be able to take six credits of course work per semester the waiver is not expected to mean additional costs for the college because the jobless students will enroll in courses that already have 12 paying students some schools especially those in the industrial middle west have formed partnerships with private groups and unions to counsel and train the unemployed the problem is so monumental that it is difficult for one group working alone to make progress said bob heineman a labor educational specialist for the labor education program at the university of illinois the program has been working with the south shore development commission a cooperative group of business and labor to help unemployed steelworkers in south chicago mr heineman said the unemployment rate is 38 percent and 20 000 people have lost their jobs so we need all the sources of help we can get hal stack the labor studies coordinator at wayne state university in detroit believes one of the most important services universities can provide the jobless is to advise them about appropriate training the funds of the unemployed are often limited and they can soon be depleted if they use them to finance retraining programs that don t lead anywhere said mr stack who has been working with unemployed members of the united auto workers in detroit pennsylvania which has been hard hit by the loss of jobs in the coal and steel industry is trying another approach it gave 1 million in grants this year to universities to establish ben franklin high tech centers the university of pittsburgh carnegie mellon and other universities will do research in biotechnology robotics and other emerging industries preliminary reports from erie community college in the buffalo area and other colleges and from employers indicate that the programs have been useful courses have been valuable because they have given the workers a new lease on life said dr john birkholz president of erie which has been training former auto workers and others in the buffalo area for new jobs in word processing hotel management and microcomputers it is very difficult for people who have worked for 20 years in one field to retrain themselves and to go out and land a job in a field that may pay them half as much but these people are doing it many of the graduates of our training program for clerical workers have moved up the job ladder said fannie eisenstein dean of continuing education of new york city technical college they hold top positions in data processing or as executive assistants there are indications that the more education a person has the lessl ikely he is to be unemployed according to the bureau of labor s tatistics only 3 9 percent of the 25 to 34 year olds who had four o r more years of college were unemployed in march 1982 compared with1 9 percent of those who had not completed high school charles a burns director of community college education services of the state university of new york predicts that more colleges and universities will offer programs for the unemployed thanks to the federal job training partnership act signed by president reagan last oct 18 the act requires each state to supervise local programs as well as to provide matching funds for the retraining of skilled workers who have lost their jobs through automation or factory closings in the past he said colleges and univerities couldn t offer all the programs that the unemployed required because the equipment was so expensive and many of those who would have liked to enroll quit because of severe financial problems today however there is more recognition that higher education can be important to older people who have lost their jobs as well as young ones who are preparing for their first positions illustration drawing

as a professor and a parent i have long dreamed of finding a software program that helps every student learn to write well it would serve as a kind of tireless instructor flagging grammatical punctuation or word use problems but also showing the way to greater concision and clarity now unexpectedly the desire to make the grading of tests less labor intensive may be moving my dream closer to reality the standardized tests administered by the states at the end of the school year typically have an essay writing component requiring the hiring of humans to grade them one by one this spring the william and flora hewlett foundation sponsored a competition to see how well algorithms submitted by professional data scientists and amateur statistics wizards could predict the scores assigned by human graders the winners were announced last month and the predictive algorithms were eerily accurate the competition was hosted by kaggle a web site that runs predictive modeling contests for client organizations thus giving them the benefit of a global crowd of data scientists working on their behalf the site says it has never failed to outperform a pre existing accuracy benchmark and to do so resoundingly kaggle s tagline is we re making data science a sport some of its clients offer sizable prizes in exchange for the intellectual property used in the winning models for example the heritage health prize identify patients who will be admitted to a hospital within the next year using historical claims data will bestow 3 million on the team that develops the best algorithm the essay scoring competition that just concluded offered a mere 60 000 as a first prize but it drew 159 teams at the same time the hewlett foundation sponsored a study of automated essay scoring engines now offered by commercial vendors the researchers found that these produced scores effectively identical to those of human graders barbara chow education program director at the hewlett foundation says we had heard the claim that the machine algorithms are as good as human graders but we wanted to create a neutral and fair platform to assess the various claims of the vendors it turns out the claims are not hype if the thought of an algorithm replacing a human causes queasiness consider this in states standardized tests each essay is typically scored by two human graders machine scoring replaces only one of the two and humans are not necessarily ideal graders they provide an average of only three minutes of attention per essay ms chow says we are talking here about providing a very rough kind of measurement the assignment of a single summary score on say a seventh grader s essay not commentary on the use of metaphor in a college senior s creative writing seminar software sharply lowers the cost of scoring those essays a matter of great importance because states have begun to toss essay evaluation to the wayside a few years back almost all states evaluated writing at multiple grade levels requiring students to actually write says mark d shermis dean of the college of education at the university of akron in ohio but a few citing cost considerations have either switched back to multiple choice format to evaluate or have dropped writing evaluation altogether as statistical models for automated essay scoring are refined professor shermis says the current 2 or 3 cost of grading each one with humans could be virtually eliminated at least theoretically as essay scoring software becomes more sophisticated it could be put to classroom use for any type of writing assignment throughout the school year not just in an end of year assessment instead of the teacher filling the essay with the markings that flag problems the software could do so the software could also effortlessly supply full explanations and practice exercises that address the problems and grade those too tom vander ark chief executive of opened solutions a consulting firm that is working with the hewlett foundation says the cost of commercial essay grading software is now 10 to 20 a student per year but as the technology improves and the costs drop he expects that it will be incorporated into the word processing software that all students use providing students with instant feedback about grammar punctuation word choice and sentence structure will lead to more writing assignments mr vander ark says and allow teachers to focus on higher order skills teachers would still judge the content of the essays that s crucial because it s been shown that students can game software by feeding in essays filled with factual nonsense that a human would notice instantly but software could not when sophisticated essay evaluation software is built into word processing software mr vander ark predicts an order of magnitude increase in the amount of writing across the curriculum i spoke with jason tigg a london based member of the team that won the essay grading competition at kaggle as a professional stock trader who uses very large sets of price data mr tigg says that big data is what i do at work but the essay scoring software that he and his teammates developed uses relatively small data sets and ordinary pcs so the additional infrastructure cost for schools could be nil student laptops don t yet have the tireless virtual writing instructor installed but improved statistical modeling brings that happy day closer

lead two weeks ago i b m and other leaders of the american computer industry took a page out of japan s post war industrial history they organized a cooperative venture to rebuild a manufacturing industry this one in memory chips that has been devastated in trans pacific battle two weeks ago i b m and other leaders of the american computer industry took a page out of japan s post war industrial history they organized a cooperative venture to rebuild a manufacturing industry this one in memory chips that has been devastated in trans pacific battle and almost weekly congress has been holding hearings on the need for an america inc a washington effort to help the country gain a new competitiveness in everything from supercomputers to high definition television to hypersonic aircraft but here in tokyo the japan inc that america is emulating is in the midst of enormous transformation privately and sometimes even publicly scientists engineers and some of the nation s top executives say they depend far less than ever on the ministry of international trade and industry whose blue suited bureaucrats have for four decades been considered architects of the policy that turned japan into an economic power by american standards the ministry s power may still appear enormous it is after all japan s commerce department special trade representative s office and the defense advanced research projects agency all rolled into one and it still plays a day to day role in the management of japanese enterprises setting research agendas and acting as a safety net for risky technologies or dying industries but the days of huge government sponsored research and development projects with mandatory participation by japan s biggest industrial players are numbered today the areas of most concern to american industry supercomputers next generation memory chips facsimile machines and high definition television are benefiting relatively little from the ministry s aid american congressional complaints aside the major advances and the hit products have emerged mainly from japanese companies working alone or together without much help from the ministry the relations between government and industry in japan have fundamentally changed said makoto kuroda one of the ministry s most senior officials until last year we have no controlling power any more such demurrals are in the ministry s own interest since they suggest that the japanese economy operates much like the free markets of the west it does not but without question industry here no longer needs the ministry s watchful eye or much of its money hitachi ltd alone spent about 2 2 billion on research and development last year or about 50 percent more than the ministry s r d budget these days companies even signal to the ministry what key technologies should be on its annual list of urgent projects i am sure miti has initiated something in its recent life said dennis encarnation a harvard business school professor who has been studying the organization from a desk inside the ministry but i still can t find it the ministry may be partly a victim of its own success its earlier mandate was to help japan catch up with foreign business rivals see box and it did so with a vengeance these days the most formidable competitors of japanese companies are often other japanese companies increasingly reluctant to share secrets with japanese rivals many hoard their best work in their own laboratories and give the collective projects heralded by the ministry of international trade and industry only token commitment companies are also increasingly wary of the ministry s uneven track record its failure to make breakthroughs in its fifth generation artificial intelligence project for example whatever the reason companies that once heeded the ministry s every wish have now developed a sixth sense about when to cooperate and when to strike out on their own this internalization of the ministry s style has been most evident in high definition television developed by japanese companies and nhk japan s answer to the british bbc without much ministry help but the ministry s loosening grip will not make japan a less formidable competitor in the long run it may even pose bigger problems for the united states the absence of central government control has already triggered spending wars here on r d more production capacity and more automation that seem bound to put american companies at a greater disadvantage that is already happening in the memory chip business where nec toshiba hitachi and others are in a multibillion dollar race to out produce each other and in the auto industry where japanese companies are frantically adding new lines the view from abroadnow in fact foreign competitors who once complained about the ministry s iron grip on industry may soon be complaining about its waning influence both tokyo and washington have turned to the ministry to solve trade tensions that are poisoning relations between the two the ministry has responded with meetings like the one two weeks ago when its new minister seiroku kajiyama dragged executives from 160 companies into the basement of his office s main building and lectured them on the need to contain exports and buy more american chips and west german cars his minions are quietly trying to keep the nation s super rich from buying prominent american properties like the sears tower the public nature of the meeting may illustrate how tenuous the ministry s influence has become in the past a quiet word would have solved the problem and so far the efforts haven t met with great success japanese direct investment in the united states totaled 21 7 billion last year a huge increase over 1987 the trade surplus with the united states is stubbornly stuck at roughly 50 billion still a safety netthe question of whether the ministry has lost power is a subject of hot debate in tokyo determining who holds the reins is always tricky in japan and it has never been harder than in the past year when two major scandals temporarily crippled the political power structure some believe that the bureaucracy which also includes the ministry of posts and telecommunications and the fast rising ministry of finance has always been the true power in japan even with fewer command powers said chalmers johnson a university of california professor and the author of the 10 year old miti and the japanese miracle the ministry remains a think tank a strategic organization that still has a tremendous ability to guide capital scientists agree if you are trying to get money from your board of directors for something pretty arcane it makes all the difference if you can say oh and miti s started a project said one hitachi researcher earlier this year recently the ministry s endorsement of the hypersonic aircraft the orient express that would fly from new york to tokyo in a few hours triggered studies at companies like mitsubishi heavy industries and japan air the ministry also continues to insure against some failures indeed one of its key roles is protecting japan s strategic technologies that is why executives here were shocked when america s congress despite its rhetoric about the importance of its supercomputer industry did nothing when control data closed its eta supercomputer subsidiary earlier this year since we come from very different cultures i cannot say what should have been done said takuma yamamoto the president of fujitsu shortly after eta america s second largest supercomputer operation closed but if eta were a japanese company it would still exist today but a good place to find evidence of the ministry s waning role is at places like fujitsu ltd s giant factory in numazu on the lower slopes of mt fuji fujitsu is trying to challenge america s dominance in supercomputers it fills its own with some of the world s fastest chips also made by fujitsu what is striking in talks with fujitsu designers and foreign technology analysts is how little the company s recent rise has depended on government help the ministry of international trade and industry has a venture in high speed computing called the superspeed project but it is mostly aimed far in the future our commercial products have benefited very little said toshio hiraguri who heads fujitsu s development of large systems one problem for us is that the results of national projects are open we have to pay a license for what we use and our competitors get it too the ministry s diminished power was underscored late last year when ana japan s second largest airline dealt an embarrassing blow it considered and then rejected the vt 2500 engine built by a consortium in which japanese companies had a 30 percent interest in favor of a competing engine built largely by the general electric company miti was angry for a long while an ana executive said but we had to decide what was the best engine a decade ago he volunteered he would have been told what the best engine was a small tug of war the ministry s superconductivity project is one of its largest but although virtually every major japanese company is participating few turn over their best researchers a senior nec executive described a small tug of war between the national superconductivity project and his company over who would get nec s top talent and all the other big players toshiba mitsubishi electric the japanese utilities have parallel projects in which they are investing much more such skirmishes have pushed the ministry into the riskiest most expensive and most distantly profitable projects more goal oriented than basic research but too vague to be called applied research so that companies feel they run little risk of tipping their hands the superconductivity project suggests how japanese industry will organize itself in the 1990 s competing fiercely on products with a time horizon of 5 or 10 years and cooperating on many things that take longer but the ministry s toughest mission is to be a buffer between japanese industry and a world that increasingly resents japan the new task involves changing generations of attitudes about imports and containing japanese business abroad it also involves a new breed of bureaucrat a bureaucrat like takeshi isayama who headed the ministry s americas and oceania division until he was moved a few weeks ago in a biennial shift to one of the ministry s industrial sections for two years from the chaotic americas desk he has represented both japanese business and in a strange way the american government to the outside world he has put forth arguments about why japan works the way it does explaining how long it takes to change an overly complex retail distribution system or warning that america s decision to name japan as an unfair trading country could easily inspire emotional and nationalistic responses in both countries within japan mr isayama has been pressing japanese companies to reform the incestuous practices that make them virtually impenetrable to foreigners seeking to sell components when the trade figures worsened earlier this year he proposed discussing individual company s situations in terms of trade who is promoting imports or helping reduce the deficit who is not that is radical talk in a place like japan where companies do whatever they can to avoid being singled out for criticism i didn t win this one he said the ministry s slowness to act is revealed in the supercomputer disputes for years japanese companies have offered academic discounts of 80 percent or so to universities purchasing supercomputers an effort to get their machines in wide circulation discount diplomacythe effect was to freeze out american companies washington has complained for years but only after it threatened retaliation a few weeks ago under the new trade bill did the ministry say it would issue an administrative guidance to bar the universities from getting discounts bigger than 50 percent it is miti that must take the lead in changing the traditional way we do business mr isayama said but this means convincing industry that japan is facing a critical image problem and that he says is a difficult task for a bureaucracy that is losing power every day in the towers of the high tech miracle tokyofrom inside its two office towers in kasumigaseki the government center near the imperial palace here the ministry of international trade and industry looks more like a decrepit insurance agency than the mastermind of a high tech miracle paper is piled everywhere employees sit elbow to elbow at battered gray desks that seem to date from the american occupation some of them do conferences with visitors take place on fraying couches hemmed in by filing cabinets there is a central computer system but it is hardly at everyone s fingertips even in the information processing section which oversees the world s second largest computer industry a few workers prop toshiba laptop computers on their desks but appearances aside the ministry remains the repository of much of japan s best young talent ambitious throngs from the senior class of the university of tokyo japan s single school equivalent of the ivy league compete each year for entry level slots at the ministry from early on they are given enormous responsibility and are rarely shy about using it a semiconductor industry executive recently fumed to a reporter that he had spent a morning at the ministry being lectured about his business by a condescending arrogant little bureaucrat young enough to be his son the ministry is 40 years old this year and such complaints go back to its beginning in its early days it placed strict import quotas on everything from cars to computers and forced foreign companies to license critical technologies to japanese partners if they wanted to invest directly in japan it used state managed banks to funnel funds into automobiles petrochemicals and steel and it allocated scarce foreign exchange and rebuilt industrial groups into keiretsu related companies with interlocking stock ownership usually including a trading company and a bank the ministry s better known role as the hidden hand behind japan inc started in the 1960 s wielding administrative guidance notices and organizing consortiums of companies it navigated the oil crises merged steel companies and began japan s thrust into high technology not everyone views its power as benign in a controversial new book the enigma of japanese power karel van wolferen a tokyo journalist argues that it is a premier blackmailer collecting information about corporate wrongdoing and threatening companies with exposure if they do not follow miti s directions not surprisingly the ministry disagrees saying that its clout in the 1960 s and 1970 s arose because companies were desperate to play catch up ball and wanted the services offered by the ministry we had an obvious foreign competitor said chikao tsukuda a former ministry official and now a consultant to it i b m

in fremont calif apple computer inc just opened a new factory that could be a flagship for high technology manufacturing in this country the plant manufactures the macintosh perhaps the hottest consumer oriented computer since international business machines unveiled its personal computer in 1981 apple hopes that half a million macintoshes will spill from the 20 million facility by the end of the year and if early orders are any indication the estimate may be conservative best of all notes apple s co founder steve jobs this is a machine that is made in america a theme he repeated time and again as he took a promotional macintosh road show around the country a few months ago but if the fremont plant is a tribute to american manufacturing at a time when most such jobs go overseas it is also a symbol of why high technology will not likely be the savior of the blue collar worker what makes it possible for the macintosh to be produced in the united states apple officials freely admit are levels of automation that 10 years ago were scarcely imaginable nearly 90 percent of the macintosh assembly process is done by machine so advanced is the apple plant in fact that the whole place can run at top speed one macintosh every 27 seconds with only about 90 workers per shift apple s experience is hardly unique numerous makers of consumer electronic goods have shown an eagerness to keep their manufacturing operations in the united states in recent months but their strategies offer little hope to the unemployed most like apple are planning to operate with few assembly line workers and many are renegotiating wage packages to further reduce costs meanwhile some companies continue to conclude that keeping their operations at home is not worth the effort tandon corporation the world s largest manufacturer of personal computer disk drives said this month that it was laying off 1 000 workers in california and transferring even more of its operations to india and singapore

policy studies at george washington university there is just not that much there some economists disagree contending that it is better to have a few jobs in the united states with workers keeping a highly automated plant running than to watch helplessly as manufacturers flee overseas they point out that every dollar spent in this country is recycled several times creating demand for service industries in the region the people in fremont are at least spending money here notes barry bluestone a professor of economics at boston college who has written extensively on the question of deindustrialization the typical taiwanese worker doesn t spend a lot in the fremont mcdonald s still the trend toward automation casts doubt on the claims of many particularly politicians and chambers of commerce that high technology manufacturing will provide employment for workers who will likely never again regain their jobs on automobile assembly lines or rolling mills and it raises questions about the wisdom of cities and states seeking to create miniature silicon valleys and willing to spend millions in public relations campaigns and tax incentives to draw high technology manufacturers economists say that the discovery should not be a surprise eighteen months ago when the atari inc unit of warner communications moved many of its video game and computer operations to asia they noted that even high technology manufacturing processes lend themselves to the kind of systematized rote assembly processes that make low cost labor so attractive since then they say the point has been proven time and again as first home computer manufacturers and now makers of more sophisticated office machines come under increasing price pressure these devices take genius at the design stage noted professor levitan in fact he said most design jobs remain in the united states but it is a myth that the production process itself is complicated in fact most of the work centers on what is known inthe industry as board stuffing the pressing of chipsand other electronic components onto printed electronic circuit boards the work is repetitive and boring and many manufacturers say it is a rare american worker who will sit still for it now even board stuffing is getting automated that is one way apple was able to operate in california its plant contains some of the most advanced equipment for the automatic manufacture of a computer but peter j barron the plant s manager of operations noted recently that there were other advantages to domestic production apart from the economic incentives we are able to keep the pipeline for parts very short so if there is a quality control problem we catch it quickly he said inventory turns over quickly he explained adding that the company could not work as efficiently if it were shipping parts overseas i personally think mr barron said that if companies really study their costs and understand where they are they will discover that there are no true advantages to being offshore it always comes out pretty much a wash between options assuming you can do it with a minimum of employment one company that has already reached that conclusion is general motors it has already begun to shift its production of car radios from mexico and singapore to kokomo ind where it is building a highly automated plant the key company officials say was eliminating as many electromechanical parts as possible making the radios all electronic and thus automating the assembly process right down to the laser etching of circuit boards significant wage reductions were also negotiated before g m approved the plan this has been the pattern said professor bluestone a lot of people say that high technology employment is increasing but i would bet the total wage bill showed a real decline still the flight overseas continues tandon for example ran some operations in singapore and india from the beginning but thousands were employed in the united states and not only in design jobs what cost workers at tandon their jobs it seems is the company s own success volumes are now very high the company s drives are used in i b m personal computers among others but competition is heating up and major buyers of drives are looking to cut costs wherever they can what tandon leaves behind in this country of course is knowledge workers the marketers designers and planners and because of the expected expansion of jobs in these categories overall high technology employment is expected to increase slightly in the next few years the question is who will benefit historically few of those laid off from the assembly line end up in more technically oriented jobs in the consumer electronics field obviously there is a need for a lot of retraining in the computer industry and elsewhere said samuel m ehrenhalt new york regional commissioner of the federal bureau of labor statistics everybody s talked about that for a long time but while i suspect that the skill level of the overall work force in these areas is rising it is rising very very gradually

but the program remains a key part of mr carters stimulus package federal job training a project nearly impossible to evaluate by lee dembart although a significant part of president carters plan for stimulating the economy now under consideration in congress calls for continuing federal job training programs there is surprisingly little evidence that such programs have been effective in the past for that reason there are many in congress and elsewhere who urge that less be spent on training people for future jobs and that more be spent on putting the unemployed to work immediately since 1973 most of the federal governments job training has been conducted under the comprhensive employment and training act about 1 8 billion is being spent this geoffrey biddle for the new york times job training plastering an apartment in east harlem year to train one million people the president wants the same level of spending next year the funds are given to state and local governments and about 500 governors and mayors act as prime sponsors for organizations that want to run job training programs typically labor unions public agencies organizations such as the urban league or in some cases private companies make proposals to the prime sponsors for specific projects in many instances these projects which may involve weeks or months of training are directed at young people less frequently the project is aimed at older workers whose jobs have been eliminated by automation and are in need of new skills the training by and large concentrates on disadvantaged workers from impoverished families rather than on the merely unemployed there are no data at all on the effectiveness of these programs largely because few participants have bean out long enough to show what effect the training had the labor department is in the middle of a long terin study of 15 000 participants but the employment act programs started after about 10 years of other federal experience in job training the results of which have been analyzed by bernard e anderson professor of industry at the wharton school of finance he studied 276 evaluations of manpower programs of the 1960s for his book the impact of government manpower programs published in 1975 and the bible in the field professor anderson said recently that people who participated in jobs programs emphasizing a marketable skill made the greatest gains in earnings and stability of employment but he said there is some evidence that the gains tended to wear off in time the gains are small in many cases and the gains do not last in many cases a congressional budget office study also concluded that there had been a moderate increase in short term earnings for participants in job training programs but that the benefits had diminished over time job training moreover did not significantly affect the postion of women or members of minority groups in the labor market according to professor andersons research effectiveness standard the most effective programs provided on the jpb training and assured the participant that he would be hired at the end the further job training programs departed from that ideal the less successful they were programs that tried simply to acquaint people with the work situation such us following instructions and showing up on time tended to accomplish little unfortunately since it is difficult to know what jobs will be available in the future or what skills in demand it is rarely possible to train people for them partly for this reason organized labor has greater interest in the other side of president carters manpower program job creation under the job creation provisions of the employment act the federal government provides 2 5 billion a year to pay for 310 000 temporary workers in local governments these include the summer jobs that 20 000 youngsters lined up in new york city for last week mr carter says the program should be expanded to 725 000 people by the end of the year at a cost of 6 billion the a f l c i o wants it to employ 1 million were al for training and services and help for unemployed people said mark roberts of the federations research staff but our general concern is more money for jobs it is not only a waste of time to train people for jobs that do not exist it is frustrating for people who are led to believe that a job will exist another objection is that training under the employment act was conceived as a program for the disadvantaged not merely the unemployed but shortly after the act was passed unemployment became a more serious social and economic problem because of the recession x large segment of the unemployed do not need job training they already have skills what they need is jobs but academic students of manpower programsand con gressional republicansprefer more money for job training and jess for job creation they contend that job creation has only transitory benefits for many and that it is better to teach someone a skill usable in a normal job than to pay him temporarily in a make work job although it may be politically attractive for washington to pay local governments to put people to work immediately professor anderson asks what will they gain in those jobs that will improve their competitive position in the labor market when the public service job money runs out lee dembart writes on labor for the new york times

reno nev a growing homelessness crisis complaints about traffic congestion worries that the economy is becoming dominated by a wealthy elite those sound like california s problems in a nutshell but now they are also among california s leading exports just ask the citizens of this city where growing numbers of californians and companies like tesla have migrated to take advantage of cheap land and comparatively low home prices a four hour drive from silicon valley across a mountain range and a state line reno is finding that imported growth is accompanied by imported problems on a recent evening chance reading an electrician who has lived in the area for 15 years went to the city council chambers to speak against a proposed development near his home in verdi on reno s outskirts he was part of a standing room crowd that lined the back wall and spilled into the lobby neighbor after neighbor walked to the microphone to complain about clogged roads overcrowded schools and a creeping sense that local residents were being overwhelmed by development our big message tonight is really about the pace of growth and trying to have a sustainable growth pattern versus a cycle of boom and bust mr reading said before the meeting and it s not just happening in reno austin tex boise idaho denver phoenix portland ore and seattle have all seen a huge influx of home buyers from california according to the real estate website zillow a common thread is that each of these cities faces a growing housing crisis that while not as severe as california s is setting off many of the same debates in washington state the legislature considered but ultimately killed a bill that would let cities like seattle impose rent control affordable housing has emerged as the top priority for voters in denver while groups in boise are organizing to fight irresponsible development such concerns are a far cry from those of even the recent past in reno where the economy has long been based on gambling and the city s status as a small sedate northern answer to las vegas a little under a decade ago reno was one of america s foreclosure capitals and the unemployment rate was just below 14 percent the gambling industry was skidding tax revenue was plunging and construction companies were either going out of business or shredding their payroll from several hundred employees to a few dozen everybody was leaving and reno was basically closing its doors lance gilman an industrial land broker said in a recent interview while wearing a cowboy hat several gold rings a gold chain and a gold watch this being nevada he is also the proprietor of a prominent brothel the mustang ranch today the city and the surrounding metropolitan area of 450 000 people are so deep into another boom that local residents are starting to wonder if the rebound has been too much too soon for decades one of reno s chief attributes has been its proximity to california it has prospered by being a refuge for people and businesses looking for less expensive homes land and labor along with the added benefit of not having a state income tax and that is what is driving growth today net annual departures from california slowed to about 20 000 after the recession but have climbed back to more than 100 000 according to the census bureau a lot of people feel like they want to get out while those markets are hot said jaime moore a real estate agent based in reno who is with redfin a national real estate brokerage firm speaking about the high price cities in coastal california as a result the reno housing market has gone from moribund to scorching as of february the median home price in the metropolitan area was about 340 000 more than double its recessionary trough of about 150 000 according to zillow the inventory of homes for sale was down 22 percent from a year earlier according to redfin and sales were happening at a much faster clip the typical home for sale was under contract in 55 days 24 days faster than a year earlier in reno and elsewhere one distinguishing feature of the recent migration is that it is not limited to retirees who sold their home with plans to funnel the profits toward a cheaper and lower tax retirement there is also an influx of young professionals like brian quon a automation engineer at tesla mr quon 37 moved to reno last year mostly for professional reasons he bought a house for 400 000 about a third of what his home in san jose calif was worth and he said reno was friendlier and had a slower pace he said he was not really aware of the debate about growing pains because he was extremely busy at work and almost no one he worked with was from nevada as the kids grow up and go to school i m sure we ll be more involved in the community said mr quon who is married and has two children under 3 in contrast to their counterparts in the bay area where the term gentrification is used carefully and with regret reno boosters and real estate agents boast about how blocks of rundown weekly motels are just months away from gentrifying come back soon the message goes and all this stuff will be torn down and gone today the typical reno rent is just under 1 700 a month up about 30 percent from five years ago according to zillow one result has been a surge in reno s homeless population the city s shelter just a few blocks past a bus station is overflowing with residents and recently added a propane heated tent to accommodate all the extra people on a recent chilly morning with a snowstorm bearing down aria overli went door to door through a motel just off the downtown strip ms overli an organizer with actionn a housing advocacy group in northern nevada passed the sounds of saws and renovations knocking on doors many residents who answered said they were on the verge of being evicted for the past year actionn has been organizing tenants in reno s weekly motels many of whom are one step removed from homelessness the group has been taking residents to city council meetings where they speak out against new local ordinances like a requirement that motel rooms have small kitchens that they fear will push rents higher the group has also been pushing for financing for affordable housing and for requirements that developers include subsidized units in new projects this rapid economic growth that has come with a housing crisis said j d klippenstein actionn s executive director mr gilman the broker and brothel owner has been at the center of reno s evolution he arrived in 1985 after reading a report titled 10 boomtowns you can count on for the 90s he and a group of business partners went on to buy and sell various plots of land for housing and commercial development that was primarily marketed toward the kinds of retirees and second home owners who had sought out reno in earlier migrations from california two decades ago the group bought several hundred thousand acres outside town and after adding roads and other infrastructure turned it into a vast industrial park among buff colored mountains that was initially used mostly as a center for warehouse and logistics operations for big retailers like walmart the park expanded as consumers did more of their shopping online but its growth took off three years ago as reno started to rebrand as a technology hub and nevada offered a 1 3 billion incentive package to bring in tesla s gigafactory as the park and its tenants have prospered the reno airport has added flights connecting it with tech hubs like austin hotels are marketing themselves as smoke free and in place of casinos have added diversions like bocce courts and climbing walls one newly revitalized retail strip has a yoga studio a gastro pub a marijuana dispensary and a bubble tea cafe on what was once used car lot since helping to woo tesla mr gilman has reached deals with various other tech companies including google and switch which runs data centers a mysterious cryptocurrency

i think we can all agree that silicon valley needs more adult supervision right about now is the solution for its companies to hire a chief ethics officer while some tech companies like google have top compliance officers and others turn to legal teams to police themselves no big tech companies that i know of have yet taken this step but a lot of them seem to be talking about it and i ve discussed the idea with several chief executives recently why because slowly then all at once it feels like too many digital leaders have lost their minds it s probably no surprise considering the complex problems the tech industry faces as one ethical quandary after another has hit its profoundly ill prepared executives their once pristine reputations have fallen like palm trees in a hurricane these last two weeks alone show how tech is stumbling to react to big world issues armed with only bubble world skills as a journalist is beheaded and dismembered at the direction of saudi arabian leaders allegedly but the killers did bring a bone saw silicon valley is swimming in oceans of money from the kingdom s public investment fund saudi funding includes hundreds of millions for magic leap and huge investments in hot public companies like tesla most significantly saudis have invested about 45 billion in softbank s giant vision fund which has in turn doused the tech landscape 4 4 billion to wework 250 million to slack and 300 million to the dog walking app wag in total uber has gotten almost 14 billion either through direct investments from the public investment fund or through the saudis funding of the vision fund a billion here a billion there and it all adds up kara swisher will answer your questions about this column on twitter on tuesday at 5 p m eastern introduced a new home video device called portal and promised that what could be seen as a surveillance tool would not share data for the sake of ad targeting soon after as reported by recode facebook admitted that data about who you call and data about which apps you use on portal can be used to target you with ads on other facebook owned properties oh um that s awkward after agreeing to pay 20 million to the securities and exchange commission for an ill advised tweet about possible funding from the saudis by the way the tesla co founder elon musk proceeded to troll the regulatory agency on you got it twitter and even though the settlement called for some kind of control of his communications it appears that mr musk will continue tweeting until someone steals his phone finally google took six months to make public that user data on its social network google plus had been exposed and that profiles of up to 500 000 users may have been compromised while the service failed long ago because it was pretty much designed by antisocial people this lack of concern for privacy was profound grappling with what to say and do about the disasters they themselves create is only the beginning then there are the broader issues that the denizens of silicon valley expect their employers to have a stance on immigration income inequality artificial intelligence automation transgender rights climate change privacy data rights and whether tech companies should be helping the government do controversial things it s an ethical swamp out there that s why in a recent interview marc benioff the co chief executive and a founder of salesforce told me he was in the process of hiring a chief ethical officer to help anticipate and address any thorny conundrums it might encounter as a business like the decision it had to make a few months back about whether it should stop providing recruitment software for customs and border protection because of the government s policy of separating immigrant families at the border amid much criticism mr benioff decided to keep the contract but said he would focus more on social and political issues at a recent company event he elaborated we can have a structured conversation not just with our own employees myopically but by bringing in the key advisers supporters and pundits and philosophers and everybody necessary to ask the question if what we are doing today is ethical and humane 23andme has also toyed with the idea of hiring a chief ethics officer in an interview i did this week with its chief executive anne wojcicki she said the genetics company had even interviewed candidates but that many of them wanted to remain in academia to be freer to ponder these issues she acknowledged that the collection of dna data is rife with ethical considerations but said i think it has to be our management and leaders who have to add this to our skill set rather than just hire one person to determine this when asked about the idea of a single source of wisdom on ethics some point out that legal or diversity inclusion departments are designed for that purpose and that the ethics should really come from the top the chief executive also of concern is the possibility that a single person would not get listened to or worse get steamrollered and if the person was bad at the job of course it could drag the whole thing down others are more worried that the move would be nothing but window dressing one consultant who focuses on ethics but did not want to be named told me we haven t even defined ethics so what even is ethical use especially for silicon valley companies that are babies in this game how can an industry that unlike other business sectors persistently promotes itself as doing good learn to do that in reality do you want to not do harm or do you want to do good these are two totally different things and how do you put an official ethical system in place without it seeming like you re telling everyone how to behave who gets to decide those rules anyway setting a moral path for the industry and considering tech companies enormous power the world like i said adult supervision or maybe better still silicon valley itself has to grow up follow the new york times opinion section on facebook twitter and instagram and sign up for the opinion today newsletter photograph by miguel

a couple of years ago salvatore magaddino who oversees the distribution of materials for the new york public library complained at a meeting that he was having trouble recruiting book sorters the people responsible for sorting the millions of books sent each year from one branch library to another it was a mundane boring job mr magaddino said the other day standing next to a result of that complaint a gigantic new automated book sorter housed in a renovated warehouse in long island city queens this machine believed to be the largest of its kind has eliminated much of the drudgery since it was turned on two months ago now when a library visitor anywhere in the system requests a book located at another branch the automated sorter does the work of routing it here is how it works on one side of the machine which is two thirds the length of a football field and encircled by a conveyor belt staff members place each book face down on a separate panel of the belt the book passes under a laser scanner which reads the bar code on the back cover and the sorter communicates with the library s central computer system to determine where the book should be headed then as the conveyor belt moves along it drops the book into one of 132 bins each associated with a branch library it s sort of like a baggage carousel that knows which bag is yours and deposits it at your feet when he spoke up at the meeting mr magaddino did not even know that such machines existed but soon after a librarian who had been there pointed him to a youtube video of an automated sorter in washington state mr magaddino did some lobbying and the library decided to order one the sorter which cost 2 3 million occupies the basement of the warehouse which recently underwent a 50 million renovation by gensler architects paid for through a combination of public and private money the library has centralized many of its back office departments in the building like digital imaging and conservation and on thursday a ceremony is to be held to mark its opening as the library services center in an interview the library s president paul leclerc explained that the new building was part of an effort to integrate many functions of the research and circulating libraries for a hundred years they were wholly separate library systems mr leclerc said describing the setup as unrealistic and unsustainable although the systems remain in some ways distinct with the circulating libraries largely paid for with city funds and the research libraries with private money many of the departments have been merged in the last two years the public library system which serves manhattan the bronx and staten island has reduced its staff by about 15 6 percent partly through the consolidations on the first floor of the renovated building for example people who order and catalog books for the two systems sit next to one another allowing them to work together as they did in ordering and cataloging the collection of the new branch in battery park city the second floor houses the offices of the digital imaging department which were formerly in the main library on fifth avenue on a recent afternoon one staff member was scanning the pages of a 19th century chinese book which had been recently cleaned by conservators while another scanned a series of maps of new york city both will ultimately be available in the digital gallery on the library s web site nypl org the air in the manuscripts and archives division also on the second floor has a distinct chill for the sake of the materials being dealt with on the same afternoon the archives staff was examining papers including those of the director and producer harold prince and of the gay rights advocate barbara gittings and of the archives of the united states sanitary commission a civil war era agency that coordinated the efforts of female volunteers the laboratory in the barbara goldsmith preservation division on the third floor features large waist high tables beneath elephant trunk shaped fume extractors it is vast for the current staff of 10 it was designed to allow the staff to grow to 30 said evelyn frangakis the assistant director for preservation downstairs in the basement the automated sorter means that mr magaddino finally has enough hands on deck whereas in the past the volume of materials coming through frequently required him to hire temporary employees now his permanent staff of 14 can easily sort 7 500 items per hour or 125 a minute he said as a result he added the time it takes for a book to travel through the system has been reduced by at least a day photograph the new york public library now sends books branch to branch with the aid of a scanner and a giant conveyor belt that delivers them to a bin in long island city c1 books arriving to be sorted at the new york public library s long island city facility photographs by uli seit for the new york times c5

aside from its environmental benefits solar energy is frequently touted for its job creation potential but for solar manufacturers themselves machines not employees may be the key to their long term survival take for example photovoltaic solar panels the most common form of solar technology as roger efird the managing director of the united states branch of suntech power a solar energy company based in china explained the process of making these cells is already largely automated but he added the process of taking the individual solar cells and connecting them to create a solar panel is sometimes done by machines and sometimes by hand depending on the company and the factory according to jesse pichel a clean tech analyst at piper jaffray companies in developing countries including china typically rely on workers to perform this task because human labor is frequently cheaper than automation technology to stay competitive therefore manufacturers in europe japan and the united states where labor costs are significantly higher will need to employ more automation technology and mr efird the suntech director pointed out that labor costs will eventually increase in china too if suntech wants to expand into developing markets he said they will also need to build factories that employ more automated technologies of course industry analysts and manufacturers say solar power still holds significant promise for job creation though mostly on the installation and maintenance side of things and mr efird and others suggested that like the heating and air conditioning contractors solar installation and maintenance jobs are more durable in the long run you cannot export those jobs he said its local people doing local work in local communities source url r m schneiderman

before adam bryants special installment of corner office on women and leadership the times asked readers to give their own advice to women who are early in their careers here are excerpts from the more than 500 responses my advice to women in the workplace would be to keep your head down work hard and know your stuff the more you know the more powerful you are always be thorough strive to be the person that people count on when something is asked of you put yourself in your co workers shoes your clients shoes your managers shoes if youre resourceful and let your wisdom speak for itself the woman thing the age thing or any other thing will fall to the wayside at the end of the day its about how much you know and how well you sell it nancy reyes managing director associate partner goodby silverstein partners new york establish a group of mentors to whom you can turn to bounce an idea around or check in about a possible career move remember that even a mentor relationship is two way and you should bring something to it send your mentor an article occasionally on an area of his her interest along with your comments you will nourish the relationship and your perspective as a person new to the field will be valuable carolyn anthony director of the skokie public library north of chicago dont just sit at the table talk at the table make it a point to contribute at least once in every meeting you attend if youre at a total loss for what you might contribute make it a point to ask at least one question at its best it should be a strategic question most business discussions are about 1 problems and their negative impacts and 2 solutions and their positive payoffs a strategic question is simply one about the problem or the solution e g how bad is the problem whats the downside if we do nothing what do we stand to gain what will we save have we evaluated alternative solutions you dont need the answers ora shtull executive coach ora coaching ltd to stand out and excel especially as a woman in the business world you need to lead think of yourself as a leader first and a consultant designer engineer etc second this will be the foundation that steadies you through the challenges you will inevitably navigate it will also be the springboard to new opportunities traci entel chief human capital officer and partner booz company my honest advice for women early in their careers is to play the game what i mean is engage in banter get to know what your superiors are into and be able to engage with them in conversation about those topics does your boss love symphonic music listen to some yourself and discover a favorite piece or composer do they love their local sports team watch the highlights from last nights game this morning and ask their opinion on how they think the game went it doesnt pay off to be strictly business all the time but dont take it too far in the wrong direction or expound on topics you dont know much about let your boss talk after all thats what most people want to do anyway these personal connections may count when you least expect them to carolyn matigian have the confidence to take more risks early on even if it means that you might trip along the way because ultimately you will learn from those experiences ask for the big assignment make that cross country move if it means more opportunity for growth although i didnt start taking risks until later in my career every risk i did take ultimately led to personal and professional development and the realization that ultimately it all works out and is just part of your journey i wish i had known that when i was just starting out as i probably would have taken even bigger risks earlier in my career marla kaplowitz chief executive mec north america my advice for women early in their careers is to establish themselves as a brand that can evolve over time figure out what your brand stands for and how your brand can adapt as you grow in your career those women who rely on superficial characteristics to create her brand identity are challenged in the future when maturity exceeds youth therefore focus on your brand appeal and how your brand acts the part you want to be and not the part you are alexis josephs vice president east coast sales and strategy vevo 1 negotiate for more money no matter how much you make you are probably not making as much as you could your salary indicates the value of your contribution also your competence is evaluated by how much money you make and this becomes critical when you want to leverage your experience for a promotion or a new job 2 keep track of your accomplishments dont brush them off write them down and add them to your working rsum we tend to forget or diminish our accomplishments over time write them down and refer to them often 3 let people know what you do well working hard isnt enough to get the recognition your deserve you have to tell people about your accomplishments learn how to express your value and to quantify your value as an addition or savings to the bottom line of your organization jennifer mcclanahan flint founder and chief strategist food on our table smile your warmth as a woman helps counter the b word you dont have to be afraid of being a woman thats who you are be who you are stop apologizing women say they are sorry far too much for things they had no control over do your own work and do it well stop volunteering to help others out sitting on useless committees or engaging in other work that does not further your own professional interests learn to say no gracefully and stick to it bring cookies from the grocer to work it goes a long way toward softening the word no when you have to use it a lot pick a few things that are going to get you where you want to go with your career and pursue them tirelessly stop the time wasters before they stop you people love to talk let them talk to you after work or to someone else you are there to live your purpose and go home to your family pamper yourself when you can and always make sure your look matches the next rung up on the ladder you wish to climb promotion is subjective so look the part and act the part but have the credentials and track record as well once more smile sheila greenfield say yes to everything assignments opportunities work travel staying late etc it will not impede your chance to find a mate but it will enhance your skill set ability to advance and ultimately all your future career opportunities alanna rutherford partner boies schiller flexner l l p one of things i hear about the most in my private practice is when young women blur the lines between professional and personal we go to work for 40 plus hours and it feels like we live there we dont and you dont office friendships with your most intimate secrets are a disaster waiting to happen you can make friendships but do it slowly you can go out for drinks but know that when you are in the office your focus is the work and not to set up shop with the gossip girls i also see how social media has crept in the mix publishing comments on the internet as if it were a private party has gotten people fired if you are not prepared to yell it from the rooftops dont put it on facebook the internet is not private heidi seifert l c s w r m a psychotherapist new york dont feel the need to act like a man to get ahead women are skilled multitaskers and should use this skill to their advantage vs their male counterparts also women are emotional beings this doesnt have to be a negative utilize your emotional skills within leadership roles to build strong relationships with your peers and direct reports jennifer mathis associate director starcom stop caring so much about what other people think especially your

another woman who you can count on to help and not hinder your career embrace the fact that you are young have so much to look forward to and can take your time getting there the best way to the top is to be honest work hard and know your self worth never compromise your self worth kelly swanson president swanson communications take opportunities even if you feel you are not ready even if it scares the heck out of you the best advice that i ever got was fake it til you make it women tend to overprepare overthink and overanalyze every opportunity and then its gone someone else has taken it sometimes the best way to learn and get the experience is to just jump in and do it project that confidence and soon it will become a part of you portia mount senior vice president global marketing and chief of staff center for creative leadership be kind learn and appreciate that the person who knows the most who can help you the most is not your boss or colleague but is the administrative assistant the secretary the gatekeeper and 99 percent of the time this will be a woman who is underappreciated and overworked jeannie gregory my advice work hard be honest grateful and enthusiastic

lead with prices stable the trade deficit improving and the reagan boom perking into its sixth year the performance of the american economy is confounding the doomsayers well not quite all the doomsayers productivity growth the most important measure of the economy s ability to sustain prosperity in the long run has been drifting south for two decades with prices stable the trade deficit improving and the reagan boom perking into its sixth year the performance of the american economy is confounding the doomsayers well not quite all the doomsayers productivity growth the most important measure of the economy s ability to sustain prosperity in the long run has been drifting south for two decades unless the trend is soon reversed it will be felt in stagnating incomes and increasingly bitter divisions over government priorities actually the latest figures show that output per hour of work rose a cheery 3 6 percent in the first quarter but few analysts are in a mood to break out the taittinger on the strength of one good quarter after years of results that hardly merited a toast in calvin cooler annual gains in productivity have averaged just 1 4 percent since 1981 down from 2 7 percent between 1947 and 1968 why the leveling off and why now snippets of evidence support every theory from the high cost of pollution abatement to deterioration in workers skills but most studies suggest that a slowdown in technological change explains much of the decline identifying the culprit as technology only answers one riddle with another scientific advance hardly seems to be slowing why isn t this rapid even accelerating progress showing up in productivity gains martin neil bailey and alok k chakrabarti authors of the brookings institution s new study innovation and the productivity crisis provide the most satisfying answer to date the key problem they argue lies in the increasing difficulty in adapting new techniques to the workplace their conclusion based on a series of industry studies offers a boost to the unfashionable view that more government intervention rather than less is needed to keep the growth machine moving the obvious link between science and productivity is research and development industry financed r d grew at about 6 percent annually but the rate of growth tailed off in the 1970 s could that explain the crisis not really output growth slowed almost as much as r d spending during the 1970 s keeping the ratio between the two nearly constant at most the failure of corporations to maintain the rapid growth in research outlays accounted for 10 to 20 percent of the decline in productivity growth the more important slippage the brookings analysts maintain came elsewhere america has long been the leader in computer technology but the united states machine tool industry fell far behind european and japanese rivals in computerization america is ahead in developing the software for office automation but the technology has yet to make a dent in white collar productivity similarly commanding leads in materials science electricity generation and bio engineering have been left unexploited the temptation is to pin the blame on all those newly minted m b a s who know everything there is to know about eurodollar swaps but cannot tell the difference between a ram and a rom messrs bailey and chakrabarti do not see it that way they believe managers are slower to innovate because new technologies are inherently riskier to put into use than the less exotic advances of the 1950 s and 1960 s how to convince them to press on economic advisers to both michael dukakis and george bush favor renewal of the expiring tax credit for private research that would certainly make sense since all the evidence suggests that the social return to r d is very high but it is a holding action at best and one that fails to address the key issue of smoothing the bumpy path from laboratory to production line here the brookings researchers fixes are bound to be controversial everyone sees the value of publicly financed basic research and private development of end user technology the brookings analysts focus on middle ground research such projects typically have immediate commercial potential they argue but the results are so easily appropriable by competitors that corporations have little incentive to pursue them to get the job done they say the government must sweeten the effort with cash the catch is that someone must pick the potential winners and washington s record in applied research is far from encouraging multibillion dollar investments in synthetic fuels and nuclear breeder technology were wasted and the sematech consortium s research in manufacturing technology for memory chips has already been dismissed by some critics as a boondoggle the best case for risking the money is that the stakes are unimaginably high an increase in productivity growth of just one tenth of 1 percent would add 50 billion to g n p in a decade and with hundreds of billions of dollars at stake even long shots can look interesting

just as president nixon found support among construction workers during the vietnam war it is here in the pc filled aisles of the microsoft partner s pavilion at the heart of the sprawling comdex computer trade show that the microsoft corporation s besieged chairman william h gates finds his staunchest supporters like nixon s defenders whose rallying cry was my country right or wrong many of these digital hard hats today say that mr gates is the victim of a conspiracy his enemies they say competitors who have lost in the marketplace turned to the government to save them when their products failed on tuesday in federal court in san jose calif mr gates s internet strategy of embrace and extend in other words to add microsoft specific features to industry standard software suffered a stinging defeat federal district judge ronald h whyte issued a temporary restraining order that gave microsoft 90 days to make its java software compatible with the version created by its archrival sun microsystems which owns the programming language or remove it from its windows software moreover that ruling followed weeks of damaging testimony in the trial of the government s antitrust lawsuit against microsoft which has seen a parade of government witnesses accuse the software giant of systematically using its control of the windows operating system to defeat its competition to be sure in other parts of the nation s largest computer trade show there were people who cheered the decision today and shared dark whispers accusing microsoft of using strong arm business tactics yet here in the microsoft pavillion one of the most crowded sections of the trade show under banners trumpeting new advances in ease of use and productivity neither court case dimmed the support of hundreds of gates loyalists in row after row of personal computers featuring windows software products of every description from industrial automation to architectural support 252 companies see themselves as living proof that the windows business model is making money for more than just microsoft these are companies that have started small just as mr gates did more than two decades ago and have prospered writing programs that run on his windows operating systems there is little love here for the idea of government regulation or intervention there is a pervasive hope that with perhaps just a bit of luck and a strong dose of entrepreneurial sweat and labor it is still possible to match the success of mr gates the nation s wealthiest person this is just big brother trying to beat this guy up said jack ross president of cedar systems a five person start up in bellevue wash mr ross views mr gates as a consistent innovator who has suffered some bad public relations defeats in recent weeks at the hands of the justice department i don t see how the government can come in and help settle the score after these guys have lost in the marketplace he said referring to silicon valley companies like sun the netscape communications corporation and the oracle corporation which are microsoft s most bitter enemies that view is apparently shared by a majority of americans a cnn usa today poll by the gallup organization that was reported on tuesday found that 56 percent of 1 039 adults interviewed last weekend had a favorable opinion of mr gates compared with 55 percent in march before the antitrust trial began of those polled 44 percent said they sided with microsoft in the trial while only 28 percent backed the justice department some at comdex portray mr gates s problem as simple politics microsoft they say has failed to educate the government on how the software industry differs from other more traditional american businesses microsoft is an extremely competitive company like many others said paula gil an alliance manager at best software a company in reston va that develops business software since going public last year best has seen the value of its stock almost double ms gil who expresses great admiration for mr gates recalled that when she heard him speak years ago an audience member asked whom he feared most as a competitor without hesitation she said mr gates answered that it was somebody working in a garage on a new idea that he had never heard about i see guys walking up and down these aisles who look like they are barely 15 years old and they are presidents of their own companies ms gil said that s the spirit of competition that characterizes this industry and that s the perspective the government is missing it was not just the cottage programmers here who believed that what is good for microsoft is good for the country among the software industry s most successful figures there are some who argue that while microsoft s tactics have occasionally crossed the line it is still important to defend the powerful company microsoft has done some bad things said gordon eubanks chairman of the symantec corporation a cupertino calif developer of utility software but at the same time mr eubanks said mr gates is the victim of a broader trend in american culture attacking and tearing down those who are too successful that view of mr gates and microsoft as examplars of success that are being tampered with is echoed repeatedly among those who believe that the operating systems marketing wars of the 1980 s are over and that resurrecting them will hurt business and slow progress it s a privilege to work with microsoft said ed murray a senior consultant at wind 2 software inc he values the broad computer industry compatibility that microsoft s windows operating systems has created they re an innovator and they re leading technology forward and it will hurt the economy and hurt our business if the justice department wins microsoft loyalists share the view that the system is not broken so the government should not try to fix it for us microsoft s size is a big advantage said robert w mosolgo president of owensville systems a six person start up in charlottesville va which makes network monitoring software they re a good supporter and it would be impossible for us to even consider partnering against them photograph what s good for microsoft is good for the country that was the battle cry at the microsoft partners pavilion at the comdex show in las vegas nev where support for the software giant was understandably high mark j terrill for the new york times

the visual world of the video generation is fast expanding far beyond entertainment to the printed word scientific reports corporate takeover proposals school assignments and what was once simply text accompanied by tabular data are now adorned with flashy histograms and pie charts more and more too color is adding vividness to these displays ostensibly the graphics are there to make the interpretation of data easier and quicker more realistically i suspect their sweeping use is a product of the very paper explosion the personal computer was expected to vanquish i would guess that a vast majority of the reports passing through people s hands are but hastily scanned on their way to the circular file however an attractive chart can catch the eye for a moment thereby imparting at least the impression that the gist of the information has been absorbed whatever the reason for the growing use of graphics having at least one graphics package on hand has become more or less de rigueur among devoted computerists chart master 375 for the i b m pc and compatibles from decision resources south westport conn 06880 203 222 1974 was one of the earliest entrants in the field and over the years it has expanded its family by adding diagram master 345 sign master 245 and most recently map master 395 these separate programs are all related in their operating style so by choosing chart master for your graphics software you have a leg up on expanding your pictorial horizons without the prospect of needing to conquer yet another program from scratch over all the decision resources programs are easy to use reliable and reasonably versatile although they are not particularly elegant fast food for the art department they replace the t square dry transfers color pens and similar tools requiring human manipulation and they add a degree of speed even though they run rather slowly by computer standards as well as automation that can save considerable time in the preparation of illustrative material the results are adequate if hardly expert in the quality of their draftsmanship a shortcoming brought about as much by the still limited graphics technology of the machines themselves as by the design of the software the flagship of the group chart master creates line and scatter graphs although the latter not from two continuous variables bar charts pie charts and area charts the available methods of analysis include linear exponential logarithmic and traveling average for those in need of a broader charting base diagram master provides a handy canned setup for creating gantt charts used for scheduling that covers up to 25 activities not a large number as such charts go but the program does include a drawing board module supplying a variety of curves arrows and other symbols that can be made larger or smaller and refined through pixel by pixel or dot by dot polishing of the lines using the program s zoom feature no freehand drawing capabilities are provided your options are limited to the lines symbols people cars boats about 100 objects altogether and alphanumeric characters furnished by the software while all these elements can be altered in size and relocated on the screen with relative ease the fact that the program confines itself to canned art does create a certain sameness in the output over 12 billion drawn and all that sign master is for constructing word charts or putting lines around columns of text to create tables checklists and the like it is probably the least fruitful of the four programs in the group map master draws maps for you then using data transferred from your spreadsheets or databases colors or shades them to highlight such features as population density key zip code areas regional distribution points and so on what is somewhat surprising about these programs is that they cannot really work with each other you cannot transfer the illustrations of one to another for instance nor can you export or import graphics files to or from the programs on the other hand the output of these various programs can be sent to a number of different printers and plotters and even to the polaroid palette if transparencies are needed for presentation slides your artistic endeavors can also be saved on disk for future retrieval or editing each picture is stored as a separate file and the programs create a disk directory of them for each floppy used incidentally however you cannot use dos the computer s disk operating system to delete these files from disk without courting the possibility of introducing mayhem among them nonetheless on the whole not much goes awry in the course of using these programs because they are relatively easy to learn and use and because they produce serviceable if not particularly exciting results that once transferred to a plotter or an image camera appear much better than they do on screen they should save substantial time for those needing illustrative material of the sort that they provide

san francisco inside a darkened theater a viewer floats in a redwood forest displayed with imax like clarity on a cavernous overhead screen the hovering sensation gives way to vertigo as the camera dives deeper into the forest approaches a branch of a giant redwood tree and then plunges first into a single leaf and then into an individual cell inside the cell the scene is evocative of the 1966 science fiction movie fantastic voyage in which lilliputian humans in a minuscule capsule take a medical journey through a human body there is an important difference life a cosmic journey a multimedia presentation now showing at the new morrison planetarium here at the california academy of sciences relies not just on computer animation techniques but on a wealth of digitized scientific data as well the planetarium show is a visually spectacular demonstration of the way computer power is transforming the sciences giving scientists tools as important to current research as the microscope and telescope were to earlier scientists their use accompanies a fundamental change in the material that scientists study individual specimens whether fossils living organisms or cells were once the substrate of discovery now to an ever greater extent researchers work with immense collections of digital data and the mastery of such mountains of information depends on computing power the physical technology of scientific research is still here the new electron microscopes the telescopes the particle colliders but they are now inseparable from computing power and it is the computers that let scientists find order and patterns in the raw information that the physical tools gather computer power not only aids research it defines the nature of that research what can be studied what new questions can be asked and answered the profound thing is that today all scientific instruments have computing intelligence inside and thats a huge change said larry smarr an astrophysicist who is director of the california institute for telecommunications and information technology or calit2 a research consortium at the university california san diego in the planetariums first production fragile planet the viewer was transported through the roof of the morrison first appearing to fly in a graceful arc around the renzo piano designed museum and then quickly out into the solar system to explore the cosmos where visual imagery was once projected on the dome of the original morrison planetarium using an elaborate home brew star projector the new system is powered by three separate parallel computing systems which store so much data that the system is both telescope and microscope from incomprehensibly small to unimaginably large the computerized planetarium moves seamlessly over 12 orders of magnitude in the objects it presents it can shift from subatomic to the large scale structure of the universe said ryan wyatt an astronomer who is director of the planetarium it is said katy brner an indiana university computer scientist who is a specialist in scientific visualization a macroscope she uses the word to describe a new class of computer based scientific instruments to which the new planetariums virtual and physical machine belongs these are composite tools with different kinds of physical presences that have such powerful and flexible software programs that they become a complete scientific workbench that can be reconfigured by mixing and matching aspects of the software to tackle specific research problems the planetariums macroscope is designed for education but it could be used for research like any macroscope its essence is its capacity for approaching huge databases in a variety of ways macroscopes provide a vision of the whole dr brner wrote in the march issue of the communications of the association for computing machinery helping us synthesize the related elements and detect patterns trends and outliers while granting access to myriad details she said software based scientific instruments are making it possible to uncover phenomena and processes that in the past have been too great slow or complex for the human eye and mind to notice and comprehend computing is reshaping scientific research in a number of ways dr brner notes for example independent scientists have increasingly given way to research teams as cited by scientific papers in the field of high energy physics that routinely have hundreds or even thousands of authors it is unsurprising in a way since the web was invented as a collaboration tool for the high energy physics community at cern the european nuclear research laboratory in the early 1990s as a result research teams in all scientific disciplines are increasingly both interdisciplinary and widely distributed geographically so called web 2 0 software with its seamless linking of applications has made it easier to share research findings and that in turn has led to an explosion of collaborative efforts it has also accelerated the range of cross disciplinary projects as it has become easier to repurpose and combine software based techniques ranging from analytical tools to utilities for exporting and importing data a macroscope need not be in a single physical location to take one example a midday visitor to the lab of tom defanti a computer graphics specialist in the calit2 building in san diego is greeted by a wall size array of screens that appears to offer a high resolution window into a vacant laboratory somewhere else in the world the distant room is a parallel laboratory at king abdullah university of science and technology in thuwal saudi arabia four years ago representatives of that university visited calit2 and initiated a collaboration in which the american scientists helped create a parallel scientific visualization center in thuwal connected to the internet by up to 10 gigabits of bandwidth enough to share high resolution imagery and research saudi researchers now have access to a software system known as scalable adaptive graphics environment or sage originally developed to permit scientists working far apart to share and visualize research data sage is essentially an operating system for visual information capable of displaying and manipulating images up to about one third of a billion pixels as much as 150 times more than what can be displayed on a conventional computer display the killer application is collaboration that is what people want dr defanti said you can save so much energy by not flying to london that it will run a rack of computers for a year more than a decade ago dr smarr began building a distributed supercomputing capability he called the optiputer because it used the fiber optic links among the nations supercomputer centers to make it possible to divide computing problems as well as digital data so that larger scientific computing loads could be shared the advent of high performance computing systems however created a new bottleneck for scientists he said over the past decade computers have become over a thousand times faster because of moores law and the ability to store information has gone up roughly 10 000 times while the number of pixels we can display is maybe only a factor of two different he said to make it possible for visualization to catch up with accelerating computing capacity researchers at calit2 and others have begun designing display systems called optiportals that offer better ways of representing scientific data recently the calit2 researchers have begun building scaled down versions called optiportables which are smaller display systems that can be fashioned like lego blocks from just a handful of displays rather than dozens or hundreds the optiportable displays can be quickly set up and moved and dr defanti said his lab was now at capacity assembling systems for research groups around the world within many scientific fields software based instruments are quickly adding new functions as open source systems make it possible for small groups or even individuals to add features that permit customization cytoscape is a bioinformatics software tool set that evolved beginning in 2001 from research in the laboratory of leroy hood at the university of washington dr hood one of the founders of the institute for systems biology in seattle was a pioneer in the field of automated gene sequencing and one of his graduate students at the time trey ideker was exploring whether it was possible to automate the mapping of gene interactions as complex a task as gene sequencing is charting the multiplicity of interactions that are possible among the roughly 30 000 genes that make up the human chromosome is even more complex it has led to the emergence of the field of network biology as biologists begin to build computer aided models of cellular and disease processes very quickly we realized we werent the only ones facing this problem and that others were independently developing software tools dr ideker said the researchers decided to take what at the time was a large risk and began to develop their code as an open source software development project meaning that it could be freely shared by the entire biological community the project picked up speed when dr ideker who is now chief of genetics at the u c s d school of medicine merged his efforts with gary bader a biologist who now runs a computational biology laboratory at the university of toronto the project picked up collaborators in the past decade as other researchers decided to contribute to it rather than develop independent tools the project picked up even more speed because the software was designed so that new modules could be contributed by independent researchers who wanted to tailor it for specific tasks we allowed what we called plug ins back in 2001 nowadays with apples success you would call them an app he said there are a couple of hundred apps available for cytoscape the project is now maintained with a 6 5 million grant from the national institute of general medical sciences at the national institutes of health tools like cytoscape have a symbiotic relationship with immense databases that have grown to support the activities of scientists who are studying newer fields like genomics and proteomics gene sequencing led to the creation of genbank which is now maintained by the national center for biotechnology information and with a growing array of digital data streams other databases are being curated in europe for example at the european bioinformatics institute which has begun to build an array of new databases for functions like protein interactions cytoscape helps transform the disparate databases into a federated whole with the aid of plug ins that allow a scientist to pick and chose from different sources for dr brner the indiana university computer scientist the cytoscape model is a powerful one that builds on the sharing mechanism that is the foundation of the internetthe idea she said is inspired by witnessing the power and impact of the sharing inherent in web services like flickr and youtube moreover it has the potential of being rapidly replicated across many scientific disciplines you can now also share plug in algorithms she said you can now create your own library by plugging in your favorite algorithms into your tool

governor orders welfare survey i he says sharp rise in cost in time of prosperity is economic paradox by ronald sullivan special to the new york times albany dec 16governor rockefeller announced today that he had created a committee to find out why state welfare costs are soaring at a time when the economy is at an all time high this is the most serious economic paradox of our times he said only yesterday the governor told a crowded news conference here that the rise in welfare costs was one thing that could push the state off what he calls its pay as you go financing today he emphasized that next years welfare budget would have to rise by at least 90 million half to pay for current demands and half for anticipated ones and to show how much the cost has gone up he said that this year s expenditures were 279 million compared with 165 million five years ago mr rockefeller said in a statement that the new committee s major job would be to find the best means of helping welfare recipients to become self sufficient and halting the rising spiral of relief costs he called it the citizens continued on page 37 column 3 governor orders welfare survey continued from fags 1 col 5 committee on welfare costs and named as its chairman baldwin maull president of the marine midland corporation of buffalo there was no mention in the governors statement of stricter measures to cut the relief roles such as longer residency requirements the elements of moral responsibility and community compassion for those who through no fault of their own are unable to provide fof themselves and their families are and must remain the basis of all welfare programs the governor said about that there must be no question he added however sharply rising welfare costs during a year when employment and the national income are at an all time high require a constructive inquiry into factors forcing so many people to seek public welfare mr rockefeller is being told that the reasons why more persons are joining the relief rolls are automation the demand for only skilled workers and the general lack of higher education among such groups as negroes and puerto ricans mr rockefeller said the committee would try to determine whether all possible means are being used effectively to provide welfare recipients with constructive help the committee was asked to report during the 1965 session of the legislature last month state social welfare commissioner george ik wyman said that of the 1700 000 men women and chili dren on the states welfare rolls only 30 000 were considered employable mr wyman and the governor s budget experts are now assembling budget requests that will be presented to the democrats who will control the legislature during the next session other members of the five member committee who all were appointed jointy by mri rockefeller and hugh r jones chairman of the state board of social welfare are john e burton vice president of business at cornell university and formerly state budget director david l yu nich president of macys james j warren president of the state welfare conference and harvey c russell vice president of the pepsi cola company

windsorthousands of apartments condos cottages and lofts are coming to this suburb north of hartford and all of the housing is to be set in the heart of the town s sprawling corporate office corridor called great pond village the 1 billion development is intended to give employees who now drive an average 35 minutes to work at the day hill road office park the opportunity to ditch the commute altogether the idea is to create the old new england village where we have a walkable mixed use village center and enough housing choices to accommodate a variety of age groups said david winstanley a principal with the developer winstanley enterprises of concord mass the company is working in partnership with the property owner abb a swiss corporation specializing in power and automation technologies about 80 percent of windsor s current residential stock is single family homes according to peter souza the town manager some corporate employers have complained that the lack of housing diversity hurts their efforts to recruit younger workers the town hasn t seen a new rental complex in more than 30 years mr souza said the development will mark the renewal of a 653 acre site that has undergone an intensive cleanup over the past decade for radiological and chemical contamination beginning in the 1950s combustion engineering performed research development and manufacturing of nuclear fuel on the property under a contract with the atomic energy commission abb acquired combustion engineering in 1990 and took on the lengthy cleanup process the final phase of remediation began in august 2009 and abb anticipates spending a total of 140 million by the time the cleanup is complete according to bob fesmire a corporate spokesman the company must satisfy standards set by the federal nuclear regulatory commission and the state department of environmental protection about half the site was declared free of any contamination the thriving day hill road office corridor provides some 20 000 jobs in a range of industries including finance insurance and transportation office buildings and service plazas line either side of the broad boulevard save for a stretch taken up by fields of shade tobacco a crop used for cigar wrappers the approved master plan for great pond village named for a 20 acre pond on the property calls for 4 010 new housing units about half rentals and 853 000 square feet of commercial space including 85 000 square feet of neighborhood style retail about half of the acreage in the development will become parks or be set aside as conservation land in particular some 200 acres in the northern portion of the site which borders the farmington river and a 500 acre public park will be left undisturbed the size of the project promises a significant expansion of windsor s roughly 28 500 strong population but the growth will be gradual the project has a timeline of 14 to 20 years this is a very forward thinking land use pattern mr souza said we re trying to look out over a longer horizon a study conducted by tischlerbise a maryland consulting firm determined that tax revenues generated by the development will exceed town borne costs for emergency services schools and infrastructure by as much as 43 million over 20 years windsor is one of a growing number of towns using high density development to address problems like overburdened highways unaffordable housing suburban sprawl and dwindling numbers of young people other towns have sought to place such development near mass transit which is lacking at the 1970s era day hill zone yet by putting housing within that zone windsor will help decrease auto dependence in the state capital region by making it easier for people to live near their workplaces said david kooris the director of the connecticut office of the regional plan association a tristate group ideally he added the town would never have developed this massive office corridor that sucked the life out of hartford but the reality is all that office space is not going to go anywhere windsor does have an amtrak rail station with limited commuter rail service long term plans for high speed rail service linking new haven hartford and springfield over the massachusetts border may eventually result in shuttle service between windsor s station and the day hill area mr souza said mr winstanley says developers will initially pay for any needed public road and utility improvements the legislature has granted the project special taxing district authority so bonds may be issued after new buildings go on the tax rolls and 50 percent of the property tax allocation will go to retire the bonds the first phase which could be under way as soon as 2012 will include 400 housing units mr winstanley said he acknowledged that the poor economy could slow the project s progress but said that housing market conditions might also work in its favor i think there s going to be more people who can t afford houses or condos he said and more people moving out of their houses because they can no longer afford them photograph blueprint great pond village envisioned for a site in the day hill

for most politicians democratic or republican the issue of outsourcing jobs to faraway countries is a no brainer it s bad for the united states economy and it s even worse for their careers especially in an election year when the work force has just lost more than two million jobs so it is unsurprising that politicians of both parties ripped into n gregory mankiw chairman of the president s council of economic advisers when his annual economic report on tuesday made precisely the opposite point that if services like software programming can be done more cheaply in india it makes sense for companies to procure them there outsourcing will ultimately enhance their productivity yet while debate is raging over globalization s costs and benefits mr mankiw s comments are based on solid age old economic arguments most economists agree that higher productivity whether it comes from trade outsourcing or technology is good even when it creates pain for many workers outsourcing does not reduce the total number of jobs in america said robert reich who served as labor secretary under president bill clinton if other countries can do something cheaper we ought to let them do it and concentrate on what we can do best indeed despite the hemorrhage of jobs since mr bush took office the past performance of the american economy particularly the pattern of job creation and destruction over the past several years supports mr mankiw s case in many ways the economists argument for outsourcing is as straightforward as the case for importing products if an indian software programmer is paid a tenth of an american s salary a company that develops software in india will save money and provided competitors do the same the price of its software will fall productivity will rise the technology will spread and new jobs will be created to adapt and improve it take cellphones which 20 years ago were luxury items with the size and weight of a brick today thanks to competition and inexpensive globalized production they are cheap ubiquitous tiny and packed with a mind boggling complement of ancillary functions the industry and the number of jobs have only increased global outsourcing also played a big role in the information technology boom of the late 1990 s personal computers were imported from abroad chip companies shipped production overseas but this outsourcing prompted the creation of new jobs here on the higher end of the technological spectrum a report released last december by catherine l mann of the institute for international economics a washington research group that backs free trade calculated that lower costs due to globalized production accounted for 10 percent to 30 percent of the decline in hardware prices during the technology boom of the second half of the 1990 s when computer prices fell 10 percent a year the impact of cheap hardware was felt throughout the economy ms mann calculates that outsourcing boosted productivity growth from 2 5 percent to 2 8 percent a year from 1995 to 2002 a gain that in turn added at least 230 billion to the country s total output of goods and services as lower priced technology flooded the marketplace it helped generate new jobs as companies that snapped up computers suddenly required software and workers who could adapt the products to their needs ms mann notes that demand for people who knew how to use computers grew by 22 percent through the 1990 s boom twice as fast as overall job creation this is despite the fact that outsourcing of computer jobs was going on ms mann said moreover lower prices also muted inflation allowing interest rates to be lower than they otherwise would be thus boosting investment and growth and the asian countries that made computers and chips spent some earnings buying other american services like legal and financial assistance over all ms mann notes unemployment in the 1990 s fell to 4 percent despite aggressive outsourcing during this period but for many unions investment in foreign lands is undisputedly bad for every investment you make there is investment you don t make here says bob baugh executive director of the industrial union council of the a f l c i o which has suffered a relentless decline in manufacturing jobs since the late 1990 s people are concerned about their own job they know it s a problem and they are absolutely stunned by the admission of this administration fears of outsourcing have heightened even further because it is no longer just manufacturing jobs that are threatened but high paying white collar service sector jobs moreover the worldwide pool of available well trained workers is much larger and they are only a mouse click away the internet and other technologies have enabled dell the personal computer manufacturer to open customer support centers in india and allowed delta airlines to send reservations jobs to the philippines the trend seems to be moving up the skills ladder oracle a software company and ericsson the telecommunications equipment manufacturer have moved product and software development jobs to india an often cited report by forrester research says 3 3 million american white collar service industry jobs will move overseas by 2015 people are afraid that they will be left with low paying jobs at wal mart yet most economists agree that the impact on productivity economic growth and jobs should be similar to that of the outsourcing of hardware in the late 1990 s prices of technology services will fall technology will become more pervasive and jobs will be created as businesses find new things to do with the technology we tend to keep the high end of the value chain said janet yellen an economist at the university of california at berkeley who was head of mr clinton s council of economic advisers we re outsourcing the more standardized part of high tech indeed employment in the service sector including those services considered most at risk of being outsourced to developing nations has not done too badly compared with the rest of the job market the united states has lost many jobs of late but that s basically because the economy fell into recession from 1999 to 2003 as the economy peaked and went bust 1 3 million nonfarm jobs vanished manufacturing lost 2 8 million jobs 800 000 management positions disappeared including c e o s and other executive jobs that are not easily outsourced to bangladesh but business and financial service occupations at risk of the kind of outsourcing that forrester research warns of added more than 600 000 jobs during the period another sector that is supposed to be vulnerable what the commerce department calls computer and mathematical occupations added 150 000 jobs moreover many jobs that are outsourced today like call center operators or data entry staff could just as easily be lost to automation productivity growth however it occurs has a disruptive side to it ms yellen said in the short term most things that contribute to productivity growth are very painful fast productivity growth is one reason that employment hasn t picked up despite fast economic growth what to do labor unions would support legislation that slowed globalization down others like mr reich want more comprehensive employment insurance ms yellen supports better education and job training but ending sources of productivity growth she said is not a good idea you could end up with an economy that does not show progress and doesn t improve living standards she said illustration drawing drawing by david

when brenda holt learned that the federal government planned to close her local social security office she swung into action that field office in quincy fla served gadsden county in the states panhandle where ms holt is a commissioner closing the office would force residents who needed help managing their benefits to travel 25 miles to tallahassee we are a rural community with many seniors and a very high poverty rate and this really angered a lot of us ms holt said we really felt like our community was being dishonored along with other community leaders ms holt mounted a campaign to save the office proposing ways to the social security administration to reduce expenses but the quincy office closed anyway in march 2014 a casualty of the cuts required by eight years of congressional budget tightening for anyone without a car public transportation to tallahassee is severely limited there is a once daily commuter bus ms holt says and it is often overflowing with riders social security did install a video kiosk in the quincy library that kiosk connects benefit claimants with the tallahassee office today it serves 75 to 100 people daily during library hours but its not a trouble free solution ms holt said we have people who can barely read because of vision problems or hearing problems video is not the answer for many of these people social security has closed 67 field offices since fiscal 2010 in rural and urban areas alike for the public the cuts have meant less access to field offices and ballooning wait times in the remaining 1 229 offices and on the agencys toll free line it also has meant long delays in hearings on disability insurance appeals and in resolving benefit errors from 2010 to 2018 congress reduced the agencys operating budget 9 percent in inflation adjusted terms at the same time the number of beneficiaries rose 17 percent according to agency data the agencys budget is increasing now and mark hinkle a spokesman said it will enable social security to reduce its backlogs we are working to modernize our i t infrastructure addressing customer service needs and enhancing online options for the public he said in march congress made a down payment on reversing years of cuts lawmakers ignored the trump administrations request for a small increase in fiscal 2018 instead raising the agencys administrative budget by 480 million or 4 6 percent and in september congress overrode the administration again approving a 40 million increase in social securitys operating budget for 2019 rather than the cut of over 400 million proposed by the white house for fiscal 2019 the agencys operating budget is 11 1 billion few government agencies touch the lives of as many americans as the social security administration in fiscal 2019 which began on oct 1 the agency projects it will pay 1 1 trillion in benefits to about 69 million recipients of social security retirement and disability benefits and recipients of supplemental security income social security will serve about 43 million visitors at its field offices and handle around 75 million calls to its toll free phone line the agency said these numbers are expected to grow quickly as the nation ages over the next two decades the agency estimates its beneficiary rolls will increase 43 percent the backlog in appeals cases for social security disability insurance has swollen in the last eight years the average wait time for a hearing decision on an appeal in fiscal 2018 was 591 days 39 percent longer than in 2010 though a slight decrease from 2017 agency data shows those delays are much more than an inconvenience these long wait times are devastating to people with severe health impairments says lisa ekman director of government affairs for the national organization of social security claimants representatives a group of lawyers that handles disability cases sometimes they exhaust their savings and declare bankruptcy and sometimes they lose their homes or they cant afford their medical treatment and get sicker sometimes they die in fiscal 2016 the agency said 9 714 people died while waiting for an appeal decision the service problems affect many people attempting to transact business with social security the average wait time to see a claims agent in field offices was 26 5 minutes in fiscal 2018 37 percent higher than in 2010 according to the national council of social security management associations an organization composed of field office and telecommunications service center managers and the wait times can be much longer people line up early at social security offices around the country said christopher detzler who manages a field office in vancouver wash and is the councils immediate past president sometimes the lines wrap around the building even for offices with more reasonable wait times contacting social security through its toll free number can be difficult and 15 percent of callers heard a busy signal when calling during fiscal 2018 according to the council appointments for phone conversations or in person visits can be scheduled in advance by calling the toll free number or a local field office most of the workers who have departed were among social securitys longest serving employees all 3 400 field office staff reductions since 2010 have come through attrition mr hinkle said its not just lost head count but lost institutional knowledge says nancy altman president of social security works an advocacy group and a member of the social security advisory board a bipartisan independent federal agency that advises the government on social security policy and its administration every year the social security administration is being asked to do more with less said kathleen romig senior policy analyst at the center on budget and policy priorities as a result many of their long term priorities are suffering such as working down the very large backlog in disability appeals and modernizing their technology they can really focus only on getting checks out and even there they are showing real signs of strain social security serves one million more beneficiaries each year if its budget had kept pace with the consumer price index since fiscal 2010 it would be 1 3 billion higher in fiscal 2019 than the 11 1 billion that has just been allocated ms romig said and that is a conservative figure because costs for big items like office rent and health care tend to rise more quickly than the c p i social security is hardly the only government agency with budget problems since the 2011 budget control act a broad range of programs have been affected but social security benefits themselves are not subject to the ongoing budget wars fought in congress by law benefits have been off budget since 1990 social security has responded to its customer service challenges by ramping up automation and use of the internet it has sharply reduced the number of annual benefit statements sent by mail encouraging workers to sign up for online accounts the agency also has begun replacing crash prone 30 year old computer systems its long term strategy states that by 2025 most transactions should be online and in person services be limited to meet the needs of vulnerable populations the technology initiatives have already helped ease backlogs 39 5 million people have created online accounts in fiscal 2018 55 percent of retirement and disability claims were filed online up from negligible numbers a decade ago but a report last year by the government accountability office found that the spread of online services has been limited by factors like uneven computer literacy and non english speaking or homeless populations and technology driven customer service requires human intervention for example employees sometimes need to help claimants correct errors or make decisions we see a lot of problems with people filing on the internet for retirement benefits says jill hornick a union representative at the american federation of government employees who works at a field office in chicago heights ill digital divide issues also come into play older low income people usually dont have the ability to interact with the agency online says daniela de la piedra a lawyer with aarp legal counsel for the elderly in washington who represents low income beneficiaries this is the population that goes into the local social security office and does business face to face slow processing of paperwork can keep beneficiaries in limbo for months or even years waiting for mistakes to be corrected the number of pending actions at payment centers the agencys back office operation has soared 80 percent since 2010 the backlog stood at 3 19 million items pending action in fiscal 2018 according to the council of associations people deserve better ms holt of gadsden county said this isnt a handout people have worked hard to earn their social security benefits if you pay taxes you expect to get services credit mark miller

lead plumes of smoke and steam billow again from the stacks of the usx corporation s gary works signaling the dramatic revival of big steel along the southern shore of lake michigan plumes of smoke and steam billow again from the stacks of the usx corporation s gary works signaling the dramatic revival of big steel along the southern shore of lake michigan but in the streets of downtown gary where the roiling clouds from the mill once meant money in the pockets of local merchants and steelworkers there is cruel irony in the industrial rebound the steel mills are booming again but gary is not like other manufacturing centers in the midwest where single large employers sustained the local economy for decades gary and its workers are victims of the new industrial reality factories are making a comeback but often the price of the recovery is fewer jobs and paychecks steel s success is city s painat usx s giant gary works which looms over the city and the lakefront the investment of hundreds of mbillions of dollars in new technology and automation now allows the company to produce nearly the same amount of steel it did a decade ago with one third the work force it s a great success story for the company but it has been a painful experience for us said thomas v barnes the mayor of gary a shabby faded city of about 140 000 the fact is a business that once employed 21 000 people now employs about 7 500 and that number is probably never going to go any higher a search for new anchorseven labor day here is not the holiday it once was from 1908 until the 1970 s the day was often marked with parades and celebrations but this year as in the recent past the only celebrations planned are picnics by union locals and other groups proclaimed the city of the century when it was founded as a steel company town in 1906 and named after judge elbert h gary who was then chairman of usx s predecessor u s steel gary has been forced to embark on a difficult even desperate search for other anchors for its drifting economy there are plans to lure tourists by allowing legalizing gambling casinos along lake michigan and by dredging lakefront marinas in the shadows of the huge steel plants david allardice an economist with the federal reserve bank of chicago says gary is in much the same situation as many small midwestern cities that have had to rely on a single heavy industry until recently whenever there was any kind of recovery from an economic slump in steel or autos both the industry and community would often snap back at a new high said mr allardice but because of modernization and automation you just don t have the big snapback in blue collar employment like you used to a lot of whiskers last month the company announced that it was investing 230 million to add a third caster to roll steel at the gary works which it describes as the flagship of the usx empire but while the new equipment is expected to increase efficiency and production it will also result in the permanent reduction of 400 jobs over the next two years the company says no layoffs will be necessary the payroll will be reduced as workers leave and retire nationally manufacturing employment has rebounded slightly in recent years to about 19 7 million workers but it remains below its peak of 21 million in 1979 and the power of once mighty industrial trade unions has declined steadily even though the work force has grown fewer than 17 percent of the nation s workers are now union members down from 24 percent in 1979 membership in locals of the united steel workers of america has fallen even faster to about 700 000 from a peak of 1 4 million in the late 1970 s said greg leroy research director for the midwest center for labor research a worker advocacy group in the steel mills these changes have altered the profile of the labor force reducing opportunities for younger workers the average age of a steelworker here is now over 40 to work in the mills now you need a lot of whiskers at least a dozen years seniority for the lowest rung jobs said mr leroy unionists also complain that much of the maintenance and general labor in the mills is now done by contract employees who work for service companies that are largely nonunion and pay lower wages poor blacks are out of luck james b lane a historian at indiana university northwest here who has written a history of gary says the new industrial reality hit this city particularly hard because it has so many poorly educated unskilled laborers that means a lot of poor blacks are out of luck as far as trying to get a job in steel he said the reductions began with layoffs during the recession of the early 1980 s when steel production reeled from the competition of foreign producers unemployment in gary topped 20 percent four years in a row beginning in 1982 and thousands of people moved away since then nearly 30 000 high paying steel jobs have been lost among five steel producers along the 20 mile crescent of shoreline around gary usx bethlehem steel in chesterton the midwest division of national steel in portage and inland steel and ltv in east chicago even so no mills closed and over the last two years the resurgence in steel profits and production has improved the broader economy of northwestern indiana edward h bowles director of area development for the northern indiana public service company an electric utility said that home sales and school enrollment are up in some gary suburbs and that 12 000 jobs have been added since the local labor market bottomed out in 1985 most are in construction retail stores and other services even gary has added almost 1 000 manufacturing jobs mostly in small factories that serve the steel industry said mayor barnes nearly half of the workers at usx still live in the city and usx accounts for about 40 percent of gary s property tax base unemployment over 11 but unemployment in gary still hovers over 11 percent twice what it is in the suburbs mayor barnes said the city has been unable to draw merchants back to a downtown that began to decline in the 1970 s when merchants followed the flight of white residents to the suburbs gary was about 55 percent black in 1970 when the population was about 175 000 now the figures are estimated at 85 percent and fewer than 140 000 a few neighborhoods are tree lined and well kept but downtown is a desert of boarded up storefronts and abandoned buildings the shell of a 300 room high rise hotel which opened in 1969 as a holiday inn and closed six years later towers over city hall a 16 million downtown convention center has been mostly idle since it opened in 1981 and even the new 1 million terminal at the gary municipal airport remains locked and empty because regular commuter airline service has never materialized but mayor barnes believes that gary s location on the lake and just 40 minutes from chicago will lead to new growth eventually among other things he and other local boosters are promoting gary as the site of a major airport to relieve congestion at o hare international and midway we have got to diversify the mayor said in a recent interview when he was elected in 1987 defeating richard hatcher who had been mayor for 20 years it was on a platform of replacing mr hatcher s style of confrontation with one of cooperation with local businesses including usx an uneasy relationshipover the years relations between gary and the company that created it have been strained even now some critics say usx is dragging its feet on a promise to sell the city 325 acres of lakefront for a new marina even though the city approved new tax abatements for the company but in early august the city and the company did join in giving a conference for suppliers and other steel industry vendors on the advantages of moving to gary more than 300 companies attended and at least one executive said his company was now seriously considering such a move it is a measure of gary s downtrodden situation that the city had no hotel of its own to host the promotion so the big caviar and filet mignon dinner to woo the visiting executives was served at the star plaza in nearby merrillville

while a senior in college alan hobbs knew that he wanted to be an actuary so he wrote to a number of insurance companies seeking employment when the northwestern mutual life insurance company offered him a job six years ago at its milwaukee headquarters he happily accepted it i had shown as a child an aptitude in mathematics said mr hobbs who is now 28 years old and a fellow in the prestigious society of actuaries but i wanted to work in a business and not just do mathematical work 40 hours a day i find this an ideal environment for that on the other hand after patricia van kampen received a master of business administration degree she wanted to work as a securities analyst and portfolio manager an occupation found in many fields including banking and brokerage but northwestern mutual recruited on her marquette university campus 11 years ago enabling her to develop her investment skills in the insurance industry i see more and more of our products based on equities so that i will have more and more money to manage noted mrs van kampen who today is assistant manager of common stocks obviously this creates opportunities mr hobbs and mrs van kampen are two of the many men and women who have chosen careers in the insurance business one of the largest in the united states today like their counterparts at other insurance companies they anticipate an expansion of opportunities as insurers like banks and brokerage firms develop other financial services as more companies broaden their product lines and seek to service different markets there may well be a larger number of people in the profession said marvin kobel vice president of the national association of life underwriters the companies are looking for people who are receptive to learning more about the full range of the financial planning process slight recent risethe united states bureau of labor statistics and the american council of life insurance say that more than two million men and women worked in the insurance field last year up 2 percent from the previous year sales of insurance companies represent about 9 percent of the nation s gross national product and more than 20 percent if businesses driven by the insurance mechanism such as hospitals and autombile repair shops are added insurance experts moreover anticipate further growth in the two major components of the industry life and health on one side and property and casualty on the other as baby boomers become major prospects for new policies the field especially the property and casualty field was at a plateau for a few years starting in late 1981 said james w hamilton executive vice president of the society of chartered property and casualty underwriters but the trend line has started up again like other industries insurance companies employ people with a wide variety of business skills such as accountants engineers investment analysts data processing professionals and lawyers but there are a number of highly specialized careers in which the best if not the only prospects are in the insurance industry such as actuaries underwriters claims adjusters and sales agents and brokers actuaries use mathematical skills to study various kinds of risks and statistics upon which they base premiums and benefits underwriters make decisions on whether to accept applications for insurance and whether an extra premium is needed because of a greater than normal risk claims adjusters often called investigators check out the details of policyholder claims before approving payment these specialists work primarily in the home office but agents and brokers most of whom are licensed in the state where they work are the front line workers around the nation who sell insurance policies to the public some represent only one company while others are independents representing many insurers selling a product like insurance usually means spending the bulk of one s time making sales calls not only to service old customers but also to seek new prospects there s a high turnover of agents said ray dry second vice president of the life insurance marketing and research association our statistics show that at the end of the fourth year only about 15 out of every 100 who start are still left as full time agents although some of the others will have been promoted to management or changed companies he added most will have left the business in addition to the career availabilities at insurance companies there are also many insurance related jobs the best known is risk manager a loss prevention specialist concerned with protecting a corporation s employees property and products there are opportunities anywhere from entry level at about 20 000 to no 1 positions at over 150 000 said hillary levine director of executive counseling and placement at the risk and insurance management society aggressive persons soughtas the insurance industry expands changes are also taking place in the types of people hired to fill its ranks much more aggressive candidates are being sought at all levels because of the heightened competition these days not only within the insurance business but in the fight against others in the financial services sector as well insurance is not like it used to be a place to go and retire said lynn merritt president of the life office management association another industry organization people with that mentality are not going to survive it s a much more interesting and challenging work environment than it was a few years ago openings in the field exist both at the entry level and at mid career points since companies frequently must go outside the industry to fill the large number of positions opening each year the best place to enter at a professional level is probably from college said linda h lamel president of the college of insurance an institution in new york city that trains people specifically for jobs in the industry but you can still enter at mid career particularly with some area of expertise as examples of those who might join insurance companies with experience gained in other industries miss lamel cited a chemist who brings a special knowledge to insuring certain chemical products or a mariner who understands the nuances necessary to properly underwrite marine insurance the industry is pretty generous about encouraging development of its employees to increase their skills she said but of all the categories in the insurance arena the one that offers the most unfilled slots industry officials say is data processing the insurance industry like all industries is constantly on the search for more cost effective ways to run a business said stephen cutter director of corporate staffing at the hartford insurance group automation is clearly a way of doing that

for all the talk of a white collar recession it is blue collar workers who have been hardest hit by the current economic slump losing more jobs and enduring far higher rates of unemployment five times as many blue collar jobs have evaporated and jobless rates are more than twice as severe more and more blue collar workers are facing the harsh truth that though the economy will no doubt come back their lost jobs are probably gone for good given the relentless advance of automation and international competition last week s announcement by the general motors corporation that it plans to shut 21 assembly plants and shed more than 70 000 jobs over the next few years only about a third of the cuts will come from the salaried ranks was just the most recent indication that the squeeze on blue collar factory workers will continue so in places like haverhill mass a struggling industrial town in the state s northeast workers are starting to train for new occupations which offer brighter employment prospects but often pay far less losing a way of lifewhen robert harrington a machine operator was laid off in july he lost a 37 000 a year position and a standard of living he may never recover after 20 years his job in a nearby plant that prints and binds telephone directories was eliminated in a cost cutting program by september mr harrington was not only out of a job he was also divorced instead of a spacious colonial home he now lives in a two room apartment with his 15 year old son robert after he deducts his rent utilities and other expenses from his unemployment check mr harrington figures that he lives on 12 a day these days a night on the town is a chicken fajita at mcdonald s mr harrington is studying in a federally financed program to be a paralegal or lawyer s assistant if he lands a job he will earn at least 10 000 less than in his old blue collar job the money will be less but i was looking for something that is recession proof said mr harrington who is 38 i don t want to go through this again traditional target for cost cutsthe unemployment rate in blue collar occupations a broad category covering more than 30 million americans from skilled craftsmen to manual laborers with varied talents incomes and circumstances stood at 9 1 percent in november according to the bureau of labor statistics by contrast the white collar unemployment rate was 4 1 percent since the peak of economic activity in july 1990 the blue collar unemployment rate has increased by two percentage points while the white collar rate has risen by one point and the number of blue collar jobs has fallen by more than a million as desk jobs over all have declined by about 200 000 of course white collar professionals like bankers and lawyers who once considered themselves immune to recessions have also lost jobs those layoffs have been well publicized and many occurred early in the economic downturn reinforcing the image of the white collar recession but the traditional american way of cutting costs is to lay off blue collar workers in times of recession and that remains overwhelmingly the case said erica l groshen an economist at the federal reserve bank of cleveland who has studied the impact on workers in various occupations joe middleman as odd man outin a series of interviews in massachusetts connecticut and michigan blue collar workers regardless of occupation expressed the concern that the hold they once had on middle class status was increasingly precarious i am the working man joe middleman said gary aldous an out of work carpenter from torrington conn but we seem to have an economy now that produces two classes the rich and the poor it seems as though this country is trying to eliminate people like me in the middle the pinch on blue collar workers has been tightening for years from 1980 to 1990 after adjusting for inflation the wages of blue collar workers fell by 6 3 percent while white collar salaries rose 3 9 percent even a strong economy did not arrest the decline of earning capacity of blue collar workers said gary burtless a senior fellow at the brookings institution the manufacturing sector heavily blue collar suffered more in the 1981 82 recession than this time around in the previous downturn 2 2 million manufacturing jobs were lost many of the cuts were made in the name of fashioning a lean and newly competitive corporate america that could hold its own against foreign rivals the streamlining process succeeded in making american producers more vigorous and recently manufactured exports have been one of the few sources of strength in the american economy yet the process of squeezing more production from fewer workers is by no means over this time companies began shedding factory jobs 18 months before the recession began since january 1989 companies have eliminated 1 2 million manufacturing workers manufacturing employment has been hard hit in this recession and for years before said thomas nardone an economist at the bureau of labor statistics fewer auto sales fewer auto partshoward miller a 53 year old machinist of jackson mich went to work for jackson drop forge in 1958 which made forged steel parts for companies supplying the big three auto makers he worked there until the place finally shut down in november 1990 laying off its last 60 workers a member of the united automobile workers union mr miller made more than 10 a hour and when the forging plant was busy he made 28 000 a year but this year such jobs have been scarce as the detroit auto makers are struggling and thousands of companies that supply the auto industry are retrenching again unlike workers for the big three who thanks to their labor contracts collect more than 90 percent of their wages when laid off workers for the subcontractors have no such safety net mr miller s state unemployment payments of 226 a week ended last may his wife geraldine died in june of a prolonged kidney ailment mr miller owes the hospital 1 700 and the funeral parlor 2 000 his 1988 buick was repossessed in july his house was paid off years ago but he is behind on his property tax payments a neighbor helps by cooking him meals and baking him bread mr miller used to bowl for recreation but he said i don t do anything anymore mr miller worked for two months this fall for a nearby company that repairs industrial machinery as a part time worker he was paid 4 50 an hour with no benefits but the weakening economy brought that job to an end in november and his prospects are bleak there is very little forging work left near jackson these days the few machinist jobs available in the region require applicants who can handle computer controlled equipment a skill mr miller does not have the auto parts industry with more than 650 000 workers is america s largest manufacturing employer but with increasing competition from japanese suppliers which are building new factories in america and hiring young workers the domestic parts industry is where the next shakeout is going to be said sean mcalinden a labor economist at the university of michigan s office for the study of automotive transportation and there s no retraining solution for the older workers in that industry a union carpenter trying to scrape byduring the 1980 s real estate boom ron richnavsky a 29 year old carpenter from harwinton conn had all the work he could handle a union carpenter paid 17 50 an hour plus benefits he made up to 50 000 a year in 1988 he and his wife linda bought a 135 000 four bedroom house for themselves and their three daughters nicole amanda and danielle at the time i was making good money he said we thought we could handle it mr richnavsky has had some work this year but not nearly enough he is about six months behind on his mortgage payments of 1 200 a month and the bank is threatening to foreclose he says his wife makes 130 to 150 a week in her part time job as a waitress his unemployment benefits amount to 300 a week we can scrape through he said as long as i don t pay the mortgage blinded by the 80 slike so many other americans mr richnavsky admits that he got caught up in the prosperity of the 1980 s assumed it would continue and took on too much debt when times are good you don t think he said mr richnavsky has thought about seeking training in another field some kind of computer training he said but not seriously as a journeyman carpenter he is a skilled craftsman who should be in demand when construction activity picks up the amount of work may never again reach the superheated pace of the 1980 s the current 30 percent unemployment rates in construction in connecticut with the number of hours worked by the state s union carpenters cut by half since 1988 is the biggest slump in more

special to the new york timesfor all their exuberance participants in monday s labor day parades have rarely had so little to celebrate no problem illustrates labor s waning influence better than its failure to join with its historic ally the democratic party to exploit an issue that both acknowledge could be a runaway vote getter a declining standard of living for most workers throughout the reagan bush years most of the nation s families have been losing ground economically finding it harder to make ends meet while a minority of families those with higher incomes who are primarily republican have gained ground this coincides with the continuing erosion of labor s membership only one worker in six belongs to a union today the house majority leader richard a gephardt calls falling living standards the overarching issue of the times yet unions see mr gephardt and other democrats as part of the problem in their frustration some have decided to withhold campaign contributions to democrats who vote against their interests they also ponder running their own candidates in primaries and on the fringe some talk of forming a third political party in several big unions rank and file members have turned against their own leaders and voted them out of office the valid issue victor gotbaum once head of new york city s big municipal workers union and now a professor of labor management relations at the city university of new york said the standard of living is the valid issue the question is is there a democratic party labor looks for a mechanism where is that mechanism for much of organized labor a better standard of living depends on protecting american products and jobs from foreign competition by restricting imports and on raising wages to regain the losses from inflation and from concessions made to management in the 1980 s unions also argue that tax breaks for workers would unleash consumer spending and regenerate the overall economy for many democrats in congress if not a majority a better standard of living depends on developing more high paid high skill jobs and training people better to do them they find trade policies that thwart development of low skill jobs in poorer countries morally problematic and they maintain that tax breaks whether for workers or for the rich would only worsen a budget deficit that contributes to the economy s sluggishness living on one paycheckfrom the end of world war ii until the start of the 1970 s when spending on the vietnam war and inflation pushed the country into the recession of 1974 75 labor unions and democrats collaborated to build the world s richest working class one in which a blue collar factory hand could own a home and support a family on one paycheck since then more inflation changes in the tax system the growth of the budget deficit and the rise of foreign competition have combined to depress most people s incomes lawrence mishel an economist at the pro labor economic policy institute here calculates that the typical production or nonsupervisory worker s average wage in july of 10 30 an hour is 6 8 percent less than 10 years ago in terms of what it will buy he said young males with high school diplomas but no college the backbone of the organized work force have lost even more during the decade 20 percent of their wages in contrast pearl meyer partners an executive recruiting firm in new york reports that the average salary of chief executives of the nation s 200 biggest companies doubled over the last decade to 800 000 the erosion in incomes shows up in delayed marriages the growth of two paycheck families more young adults living with parents and the difficulty young people have buying homes victor fingerhut a poll taker and adviser to six unions said the issue is ripe for labor and democrats to pluck people have a sense of being hurt he said if the democrats had any sense they would hammer on that stuff the decline of the standard of living coincides with organized labor s waning influence and the demise of the old manufacturing industries where wages were highest and labor strongest leading democrats in congress are partly responsible trade unionists say mr gephardt of missouri and other democratic leaders like senator edward m kennedy of massachusetts chairman of the senate labor and human resources committee and senator george j mitchell of maine the majority leader stunned labor in may by voting to grant president bush authority to negotiate a trade agreement with mexico labor loudly opposed the proposal because it contended that the pact would spell the loss of jobs betrayed and ignorednow unions feel betrayed and ignored when democrats are running and looking for people to put up the yard signs and seal envelopes and collect voluntary contributions the labor movement is able to deliver said gerald w mcentee president of the big american federation of state county and municipal employees once the democrats get in congress the amount of influence we have comes up short with their fortunes still in descent unions for the first time are thrashing about for new ways to recapture their old influence including turning against democrats the united mine workers has started running its own members in primaries against incumbent democrats who vote against its agenda the communications workers of america has decided to deny campaign contributions to democrats who oppose a ban against employers hiring of new workers to replace permanently those who go out on strike as an expression of its fury over his vote on mexican trade the machinists union canceled an invitation to mr gephardt to appear at its convention in june and the secretary treasurer of the oil chemical and atomic workers union tony mazzochi has formed a group labor party advocates that could become the nucleus of a third party the president of the united mine workers richard l trumka whose union s membership has plunged with the automation of coal mining said the idea of a third party could have a tremendous amount of merit but first he said we have to demonstrate to the worker that the democratic party won t be a voice for him greg tarpinian senior economist at the labor research association a labor advocacy group in new york made a similar point there s a much higher level of debate within the labor movement over the kinds of demands that labor should make on the democratic party he said we ve had a decade of openly reactionary anti labor rule by republicans and the democratic party has yet to come up with an alternative reliable supporterslabor leaders still find democrats reliable supporters of initiatives that help all workers like expanding benefits to the long term unemployed expanding civil rights protections in the workplace and granting unpaid leave for workers who have children or care for elderly parents all measures which the president has vetoed or stalled and people blame union leaders for labor s waning clout as much as they blame democrats who to win elections have to be sensitive to the concerns of more voters than just the 16 percent who belong to unions a figure less than half the level following world war ii these critics say that 35 members of the a f l c i o s executive council made up largely of white males in their 50 s and 60 s are mired in the battles of the past and far more secure in their jobs than the popularly elected democrats they berate more and more rank and file members are challenging their leaders for example they voted out the presidents of two transportation unions for their role in settling last april s railroad strike when you re losing members and influence people start wondering why said susan jennik executive director of the association for union democracy a group in new york that supports rank and file efforts to open unions to more democratic practices salvation for the unions and the democrats lies in seizing the initiative to rebuild the standard of living some democrats say trade protection strategy is not going to make us prosper said al from president of the democratic leadership council an association of moderate democrats representative sander m levin democrat of michigan called the decline of the standard of living the achilles heel of the republican party the situation is ripe for someone to come forth and say the whole world is changing for the better and america is changing for the worse and we can do better he said but lacking an overall vision we democrats get lost in the details correction september 5 1991 thursdaybecause of a production error an article on monday about the declining influence of labor unions included scrambled paragraphs in some copies that

they call it the not so heavy metal tour it s a lighthearted effort by minnesota based alexandria industries to introduce middle and high school students as well the general public to manufacturing while the name is humorous it belies an issue that is anything but the component manufacturing company with about 550 employees roughly two hours north of the twin cities of st paul and minneapolis faces an acute problem affecting many rural manufacturers a shortage of workers to fill skilled and unskilled positions the company which supplies manufacturers in the medical automotive and defense industries among others has at least 50 unfilled jobs and its predicament is not unusual it doesn t matter whether the company is in michigan wisconsin texas or pennsylvania said tom schabel the chief executive of alexandria industries one of the top issues is the difficulty of finding people skilled positions can remain open for months and even unskilled positions can take 60 days to fill he said shortages may seem counterintuitive given the widespread fear that automation robotics and offshoring have all reduced employment in manufacturing while jobs in absolute numbers have declined from a decade ago the sustained economic recovery a lack of skilled workers and the retirement of many baby boomers have led to open positions even though the gyrating tariff environment is causing anxiety across industries manufacturers are still hiring but up to two million skilled jobs could go unfilled by 2025 according to a 2015 report the most recent data available from the manufacturing institute a nonprofit affiliate of the national association of manufacturers as a result the previously unthinkable has begun to happen a third of companies surveyed by the manufacturing institute reported that they had already turned away new work because of a lack of manpower according to carolyn lee the group s executive director to address the shortages manufacturers as well as state and local governments are increasing recruiting efforts although no statistics are available to analyze their effectiveness these measures include higher wages tax incentives for those relocating and the forgiveness of student loans as well as enhanced training for students new recruits and current employees companies are also offering perks like on site day care and health care alexandria industries for example offers a free health clinic within a block of its facility while it was initially an attempt to deal with escalating health care costs it is increasing a recruiting and retention tool for workers and their families mr schabel said employers like 114 year old wigwam mills based in sheboygan wis offer cash bonuses to employees who bring in new recruits who stay at least 60 days said thomas wheeler president and chief executive another stopgap measure is to increase overtime in minnesota mr schabel said getting employees to work extra hours is usually not difficult during the winter summer however is another story when residents take advantage of the nearby lakes and rivers as a result alexandria industries recently introduced a program in which every employee including mr schabel was required to work eight hours of overtime per month many companies in addition are encouraging their graying work force to postpone retirement or in some cases return to work as consultants or part time contractors to appeal to a younger generation some companies are promoting greater collaboration among teams as well as renovating their cafeterias and even installing amenities like pool tables some are taking a page from silicon valley investing in wi fi enabled buses to ferry workers from greater distances we have a lot to sell in terms of integrity of our business but we need to get creative to bring the workers here mr wheeler said his company will begin to deploy buses in the fall to provide transportation for those who commute from milwaukee or green bay wis most important mr wheeler added while we need to create an environment that is safe and well run with competitive compensation and benefits that alone isn t enough we also need to offer a path for career growth local state and municipal governments are also adopting financial incentives to entice workers to move or return to their rural roots colorado jump start is a state run program that waives income taxes for those who relocate to rural areas of the state for four years businesses that locate in distressed areas can obtain relief from a range of state and local taxes for up to four years kansas has a two pronged approach it has declared 77 counties as rural opportunity zones and workers relocating to any of those areas may qualify for help with student loan repayment up to 15 000 or may be eligible for a state income tax waiver up to five years vermont recently enacted legislation to pay up to 10 000 for those relocating to the state who work remotely for companies based elsewhere longer term both private companies and state and local governments are focusing on training whether on site or by partnering with local secondary schools as well as nearby colleges determining that curriculum can be difficult said christopher chung the chief executive of the economic development partnership of north carolina industry often evolves faster than education providers as a result there s always a lag in what industry needs and what the education system is cranking out he said there s also the risk that the training is too general for a skilled pool john molinaro the chief executive of the appalachian partnership for economic growth based in ohio said he advocates for so called upskilling where current employees are trained to take on more sophisticated work for students the training can be high tech in campbell county tenn for example students don technical gear and use tools to learn welding skills with a twist their initial introduction is through a virtual reality computer program said the deputy mayor andy wallace companies are also taking chances on candidates who lack experience several years ago sheldon burslie now 28 moved away from his twin cities roots with his young family although he had neither a college degree nor a manufacturing background alexandria industries hired him and provided technical as well as leadership training six years in he has been promoted and plans to stay until i retire dana jordan the president of cascade rescue in sandpoint idaho described a man who walked in off the street and offered his services he told me that he worked on a farm all his life but with a family he needed more income i told him i don t have any cows but i can use an entry level assembler he s the salt of the earth and six years later he s still here in addition some companies are hiring former prisoners bmt manufacturing a company in rural tennessee that makes trailers has a program for inmates nearing release to train

workers but have often been overlooked that is beginning to change the defense department already has what it calls a skills bridging program for those nearing the end of their enlistments in addition the manufacturing institute in january introduced a new program heroes make america to offer more advanced training in manufacturing skills for people leaving the military the program also would connect them with prospective employers ms lee said in january the first program began in fort riley in kansas a second site will open this year in texas at fort hood concentrating on the armed forces has another benefit veterans appear to be more willing to relocate a significant number of armed forces say they want to go where there is opportunity ms lee said it s unclear whether other younger workers are willing to go rural there s a perception that recent college graduates prefer metropolitan areas but that mr molinaro said is an urban legend with short commutes and open spaces these areas can attract workers of all ages as long as suitable affordable housing is available although mr burslie of alexandria industries says he misses the proximity to his extended family he earns more and his costs such as housing have been slashed in half still manufacturing has an image problem students may shy from pursuing manufacturing jobs because of the misconception that it is dark dirty and dangerous work mr chung said the reality can be very different modern advanced factories incorporate automation and robotics in brighter spaces he said ms lee said that while 80 percent of those surveyed think it was important to invest in manufacturing only a third want their children to pursue manufacturing careers to counter those perceptions many factories open their plants to the public to show what really goes on mr schabel said other communities like gaston county n c highlight high school students who accept jobs in manufacturing by having a career signing day a nod to the annual

special to the new york timesloggers don t say timmmmmmber when a 200 foot douglas fir comes crashing down severed by chain saw from its centuries old anchor to the ground they never did as far as anyone on the olympic peninsula can remember instead after the pop and snap of wood fiber crumbling into the arms of gravity gary phillips takes a deep breath smell that says mr phillips a third generation logger who is cutting his last stand of timber that s the smell of dying trees it wasn t so long ago that the olympic peninsula home of the only temperate rain forest in the contiguous united states called itself the logging capital of the world a big man and a chain saw could cut enough trees in a day to build two average sized houses of course those trees may have lived five centuries and harbored untold biological secrets and therein lies the conflict the public owns most of the big trees left in the country more and more they are valued for something other than building materials because of environmental restrictions concern about the shrinking habitat of endangered wildlife like the northern spotted owl automation and over cutting on some lands the timber industry here is but a ghost of what it once was this spring mr phillips who owns one of the last of the small timber operations on the peninsula is closing his business for him and his crew this is the final clear cut increasingly wood for new american homes comes from canada the south or the big northwest tree farms owned by companies like weyerhauser less than 15 percent of the nation s wood comes from the national forests and some critics would like to see all logging halted on federal lands farmers not villainsthese men do not see themselves as land rapists or villains they say they are more like farmers harvesting a crop nature mr phillips said has downed more trees through fire and wind than any logger a salmon fisherman once asked me if i felt bad cutting down all these big trees mr phillips said i said no sir have you ever felt bad taking in a big salmon but these men concede that most of the really big trees are gone and in many ways the loggers still working in the last years of the 20th century are paying for the sins of others i cut a tree once 18 feet in diameter but have not seen anything like that for many years said bob french who has spent most of his 57 years in the woods they gather on this day in darkness an hour before dawn at a restaurant along highway 101 called the logger s landing everyone wears spiked boots and suspenders because belts don t hold the pants up just right they consume enough eggs and bacon to shock a heart surgeon into palpitations on the walls are pictures of the glory years a dozen or more loggers standing proudly atop a single tree stump 70 acres of timbermr phillips who has a bearskin rug over the couch at home elk trophies on his walls and antique rifles displayed in a glass topped coffee table started h p logging with his partner pat handly they are contract loggers meaning they cut trees on contract for the purchaser of the timber their final timber harvest is a 70 acre piece of land owned by the state logging on federal land on the peninsula has come to a virtual standstill because of restrictions to protect the northern spotted owl in all the years that mr phillips s crew has been logging not a man can remember seeing a spotted owl although a few dead owls have been found nailed to posts here in the olympics a sign of the intense bitterness some men feel the loggers on mr phillips s crew say they respect wildlife more than the average city dweller the olympic peninsula a massachusetts sized shank of land in the far northwest corner of washington state can get heavy rains up to 180 inches a year on its western side while the eastern side basks in sun the interior of the peninsula is the olympic national park it is bordered by the olympic national forest two thirds of which has been logged the remaining land is private or owned by the state of washington much of the private land has been severely cut leaving vast stretches of stumps and brown earth clear cutting considered the most economical way to cut trees in the thick forests of the pacific northwest is the only way most of the men on the h p crew have ever logged in a typical clear cut the land is cleared of every tree the logs gathered into neat piles the brush burned and the ground replanted on this cut the loggers start at the bottom of the slope and work their way up deer black bears mice coyotes and numerous birds may live in this particular 70 acres just above a saltwater inlet of puget sound after the chain saws start up the prime concern is wood a single large tree can yield lumber worth as much as 30 000 when all the trees are felled from this section they will provide enough wood to build about 230 houses much of this wood after being cut into framing timber will go to japan lee olson uses a chain saw with a 36 inch blade to bring down the trees he is massively built with thick upper arms and bulging chest inside a mickey mouse t shirt it takes all of about five minutes to cut a century old douglas fir the hardest part he said is keeping his footing while holding the saw steady mr olson has scars all over his legs and arms from where the saw has bitten into his skin three of his uncles have been killed on logging jobs and he has lost several good friends as well on average one of every three loggers is killed or seriously injured on the job during the length of a career but even with the danger mr olson who is 33 years old said there was no job he would rather have than being a lumberjack vanishing vocation i like the satisfaction of looking back at the end of the day and seeing what you ve accomplished mr olson said every tree is a different challenge no two trees are the same he can determine the way a tree is going to fall by cutting at an angle on the opposite side of the downslope when he is done he steps back and watches the crash mr olson is something of an anachronism the big companies that provide most of the nation s wood from their tree farms cut timber with a 300 000 machine that can pinch off a tree trunk like pruning shears on a plant in the last 15 years even before a single acre was set aside for the spotted owl the northwest lost 30 000 timber jobs while gaining more than 800 000 jobs in other fields wood products which once drove the economy now accounts for only 2 percent of all jobs in western washington and in the next 25 years an additional 30 000 jobs are expected to be lost throughout the northwest if proposals to set aside six million acres for the spotted owl are approved some economists have said that tourism will replace logging as the economic mainstay of timber communities but many loggers say they will never become waiters or tour guides mr olson said he wanted to build houses mr phillips may work with plants mr handly is not sure what he will do none of them seemed particularly bitter the environmentalists have done their homework mr phillips said in a sort of back handed compliment they got out ahead of us and then before we knew it it was basically over we never knew what hit us as the jobs and towns built around logging have disappeared some people have romanticized it talking about a logger s culture of pickup trucks and brawny work but the men on this final clear cut scoff at such notions what we do is all about one thing and one thing only money mr french said timber workers here make about 14 an hour when mr olson has felled enough trees he cuts them into sections about 40 feet each sized for fitting on a truck then a yarding crew comes along hooking up the logs to massive steel cables connected to a hydraulic pulley from there they are loaded on trucks and sent to a mill in tacoma just plain ugly the forest floor stripped to the bare earth in parts covered with limbs and brush in others after the loggers have finished looks like it has been hit by a hurricane there s no way around it a clear cut is just plain ugly mr phillips said but he sees life where others see death we ve had lots of clear cuts where i thought we did a great job he said but then your average person comes along and says it s a catastrophe people just don t understand what it is we do as part of what is known as the new forestry not all the trees is this clear cut were cut a small section bordering a stream was left standing as were several old trees used by birds but the loggers complained that it caused more environmental damage to leave some standing trees because the crew had to build twice as much road to get around the trees left near the stream the road gouged into the side of the hill is already causing erosion and runoff of sediment we re supposed to make a clear cut that s not really a clear cut said mr handly it s ridiculous mr phillips s grandfather was a logger who came to the northwest from maine via wisconsin a fairly typical path for workers who followed the declining timber harvests from one coast to the other mr phillips s father was a logger as well and he advised gary not to get into it although mr phillips is not sure what he ll do when he hangs up his saw this spring he is thinking about starting a nursery he does have another project in mind a museum depicting the history of logging on the olympic peninsula for artifacts he said he need go no farther than his own front yard where he keeps the big tools of the tree cutting

hi welcome to on politics your guide to the day in national politics lisa lerer is on vacation today so im your substitute host matt stevens get on politics delivered to your inbox i spent this past weekend in new hampshire with the entrepreneur and democratic presidential candidate andrew yang along seven stops on the campaign trail i got pretty familiar with his stump speech which is something of a mini lecture on the state of automation and the history of universal basic income loaded with data and mostly lacking in big applause lines but what is particularly interesting is what he doesnt talk about mr yang does not mention president trump until the very end and even then his intention is to pay mr trump a sort of backhanded compliment he got the problems right mr yang likes to say but his solutions were the opposite of what we need at a time when some of mr yangs more well known rivals for the democratic nomination have either built their candidacy around being the anti trump or have revamped their campaign to target him im looking at you joe biden kamala harris and beto orourke mr yang has caught on with some trump voters by harping on the pain and suffering people feel when they lose their jobs and concerning himself with how to soften the blow he argues that free money is a solution even republicans would go for and points out that the one state where a universal income passed is alaska which leans heavily conservative he has happily done interviews with conservative media commentators including ben shapiro and tucker carlson and although he tweets often he almost never tweets about mr trump exactly how much of his modest success so far in the presidential primary is because of his welcoming stance toward the right is not clear but mr yang has managed to make the cut for the third debates by polling at 2 percent or above several times and attracting donations from more than 130 000 people a feat only nine other candidates can say they have accomplished though he remains a very long shot to win the nomination when all you need is 2 percent support to claim a measure of success every little bit of enthusiasm counts republican voters i talked to like austin snell a 21 year old college student who voted for mr trump in 2016 expressed fatigue over the constant attacks being leveled in politics and what they saw as the two parties staking out extreme positions on either side of divisive issues like immigration despite mr yangs liberal and progressive views on most issues voters i talked to said they considered him more of a pragmatic centrist who formed his policy ideas based on data rather than ideology he has correctly identified the problems facing our country mr snell of litchfield n h said of mr yang he hits on a lot of common topics that people agree on mr snell who said he had listened to mr yangs audiobook the war on normal people said he was pleased to hear the candidate express concern about truck drivers call center workers and other well normal people he also said some of his fraternity brothers who are fervent supporters of mr trump are giving mr yang a hard look if its yang versus trump theyre going to have some thinking to do he said make no mistake mr yang is no fan of the president but he has made it clear he does not hold a grudge against people for having voted for him in fact mr yang has labeled himself as nonideological and created a popular campaign slogan that signals as much not left not right but forward as a result many of mr yangs fans republican and democrat alike have begun to fashion an electability argument around their still somewhat fringe candidate and view him as the person best equipped to both beat mr trump and unite the country you see all these other candidates who are great at bringing up problems but when it comes to solutions they just blame trump said vipul periwal a supporter who drove from his home in maine to attend multiple yang events in new hampshire yang is very positive in the way he carries himself and he tries to reach out to people on all sides of the political spectrum you hear democratic candidates say they want to get trump supporters on board but then they try to distance themselves yang wants all americans drop us a line we want to hear from our readers have a question well try to answer it have a comment were all ears email us at on the ferris wheel with michael bennetwere down to our final installment of our series candidates on rides in iowa in this fourth edition senator michael bennet takes the grand wheel with three of our esteemed colleagues reid j epstein shane goldmacher and sydney ember poor sydney we all remember how much she loves rides and iowa this might be goodbye to our series but its far from farewell well be back soon reid epstein all right senator compare this to the state fair in colorado michael bennet we love the state fair in colorado in pueblo this one is bigger and its fascinating to meet people from all over the place sydney ember i hate ferris wheels bennet you hate what sydney ferris wheels bennet dont hate the ferris wheel sydney if i close my eyes dont be concerned reid what did you eat bennet we started out with the caramel apples egg roll which won the prize last year then i had a what was the bar called a wonder bar a wonder bar which is a confection of vanilla ice cream chocolate and peanuts i had that a little bit for breakfast today i had a corn dog shane goldmacher how do you avoid this being your high point in iowa right now bennet this is pretty good thats an excellent joke by putting one foot in front of the other and keep working i really think the base of the democratic party in iowa is where i am and i think im more used to running in a place like this than a lot of the other candidates this feels a lot like home sydney you attacked bernie sanders a lot in your soapbox speech do you think hes sliding in iowa bennet i think that one reason is medicare for all i understand his ideological commitment to it i respect it actually and i respect how honest he is about what hes proposing hes virtually the only one who really tells the truth about it as bernie said im the one who wrote the damn bill and he is the one that wrote the damn bill and he knows whats in the bill and notwithstanding his ideological conviction i dont think thats what democrats in iowa want i think they want a public option they want a chance to make a decision for their families about how to get to universal health care reid in the last few days theres been a couple of sort of classic biden gaffes are you concerned that if hes the nominee that his inability to speak clearly will cost the party in the general bennet look i mean hes going to have to show over the course of the election that he can do it but were all going to have to demonstrate that and the ride approaches the end i want to go around again and you were very brave at the top when they stopped after saying that you didnt like being on a ferris wheel sydney oh i appreciate that bennet but theres a lot of folks in this race that represent a new generation of leadership it seems to me thats where we should head as a party reid weve asked everybody whos been on these rides with us has there been a more humiliating interview than being on the ride with us bennet being on the ride no i like being able to see the fairground and i like being able to stop at the top and i like being able to bring my kids with me so it was great many have high hopesthis week our colleague astead herndon teamed up with the timess designers programmers and music critics on a really cool project looking at the playlists that candidates use at their rallies they analyzed the playlists to see how the music aligned with the candidates core messages heres what they discovered what to read tonight yes the senates design makes it difficult for one party to enact sweeping legislation on its own yes the filibuster

with the hot humid days of midsummer upon us and with offices and households using huge amounts of electricity to run their airconditioners it may be wise to review the lessons learned during the energy crisis of 1974 and the conservation efforts that followed the lessons concern not only a new sense of discipline in energy use but also an urgent need for more efficient machinery detroit has been hard pressed to produce more fuel efficient cars and the manufacturers of air conditioning systems have faced an equally challenging problem consider for example the federal government s order in 1979 that its office buildings across the country be heated to no more than 68 degrees in the winter and cooled to no lower than 78 degrees in the summer although the rule still applies it has been widely judged a failure because of the inefficiency of the complicated air treatment systems in large office buildings the problem is that these systems can t be fine tuned to get the right temperature throughout a building said george n chatham an engineer who follows air conditioning and energy consumption for the congressional research service in washington he said the temperature limits were being disregarded in many cases and in other buildings he added energy savings had been sharply reduced because hot office workers have brought electric fans into their work areas in fact the energy crisis has prompted important advances in controlling the amount of electricity used to air condition homes these advances air conditioner manufacturers say have resulted largely from a greater use of insulation in homes as well as improved efficiency for the small residential units brought to market over the past five years but maintaining a comfortable level of coolness in many office buildings factories and other large buildings remains a difficult and increasingly expensive task designing better air conditioning systems for the these structures has become an area of intense technological interest the idea shouldn t be to set arbitrary limits on heating and cooling but to come up with some reasonable level of energy consumption asserted clinton phillips president of the american society of heating refrigerating and air conditioning engineers a trade association based in atlanta once a limit is placed on energy consumption mr phillips added you design a better system that does the job of keeping people comfortable he estimated that a variety of energy conservation measures and design alterations if put into use in many large buildings could increase their energy efficiency fourfold engineers and architects face fewer problems designing airconditioning systems for new buildings than they do in refitting older structurers in systems installed more than eight years ago the cost of electricity wasn t a problem and the initial cost of the system was considered much more important than its efficiency said lawrence beresik director of marketing for the carrier corporation a major manufacturer of systems for large buildings as a result technology that was known to lower energy consumption was not used air ducts to enable better ventilation were not built in wiring and controls that would have resulted in a greater uniformity of temperature from room to room were not installed in large office buildings refitting an old power guzzling system might require an investment of more than 1 million mr beresik said nonetheless he added the cost could often be paid off through lower energy bills in one to three years engineers and air conditioner manufacturers say their new systems provide more uniform temperature levels in different areas of buildings and make greater use of circulating air instead of refrigerating relatively still air it obviously costs less to move air with a fan than to refrigerate it said richard wright director of technology for the engineering association the new systems also have more sensitive controls to turn them off and on in response to relatively slight changes in external temperatures at carrier for example mr beresik said that new commercial systems were available that sensed even the fleeting movement of the sun behind a cloud and then made subtle adjustments in the amount of power being used for cooling the most efficient systems for large buildings some engineers say may ultimately have computerized control mechanisms and electronic temperature sensors in every room although computers have been used to control some heating and cooling functions in large buildings for more than a decade tony autorino president of the building automation group of the united technolgies corporation said interest in the technology had mushroomed over the past two years the objective is a building that lives thinks and breathes mr autorino asserted at united technologies he said engineers had designed a system of electronic sensors that could be installed in telephone wires running throughout large buildings the sensors transmitting temperature and humidity readings from hundreds of locations in a structure are connected to a central computerized air conditioning system mr autorino added that a similar system could be designed with sensors wired separately from the telephone system but in any case he said obtaining a maximum level of efficiency in computercontrolled air conditioning required a systems approach rarely used in the past it would also require a far bigger initial investment illustration cartoon

the obama administration is dismantling a dormant national registry program for visitors from countries with active terrorist groups a program that president elect donald j trump has suggested he is considering resurrecting the registry created after the attacks of sept 11 2001 has not been in use since 2011 so the move is largely symbolic and appeared to be aimed at distancing the departing administration from any effort by the new president to revive the program known as the national security entry exit registration system or nseers asked on wednesday in the aftermath of the berlin attack whether he still intended to set up a registry for muslims and impose a temporary ban on muslim immigrants mr trump said in florida you know my plans hours later a spokesman said mr trump was not reaffirming his earlier calls for a ban on immigration from muslim countries but was referring to his more recent clarification that he would bar people from countries with a history of islamist extremism the move by the white house to formally end the registry is among the actions being taken in the final weeks of the administration that could prevent or at least slow what democrats fear may be a swift rollback of president obama s efforts on immigration and climate change a spokesman for mr trump did not immediately respond to requests for comment among the republican proponents of the registry program is kris kobach the kansas secretary of state and a member of mr trumps transition team mr kobach an anti immigration hard liner helped to devise the program while at the justice department during the george w bush administration last month before a meeting with mr trump mr kobach was photographed with a document of first year proposals that included under the rubric bar the entry of potential terrorists a proposal to reintroduce the registry program that information as well as mr trumps comments on the campaign trail prompted democratic lawmakers mayors from cities with large foreign born populations and some business leaders in silicon valley to call on mr obama to undo the legal framework that undergirds the program that can be done with a rule change the department of homeland security submitted such a rule change for public posting on thursday morning and it is set to be published in the federal register on friday d h s ceased use of nseers more than five years ago after it was determined the program was redundant inefficient and provided no increase in security neema hakim a spokesman for the department of homeland security said in a statement the program is not only obsolete and outdated but diverts personnel and resources from other areas that are seen as more effective the statement said some experts say there is no need for a registry officials in the agency have long believed that the program has outlived its usefulness a number of newer programs developed in the years since the nseers system was put into place capture a vast amount of information that allows customs officers to flag for additional questioning people from certain countries or those with unusual travel itineraries a 2012 report by the inspector general for the department of homeland security said that since 2006 senior officials in the agency had been calling for the termination of the program and in the report the inspector general recommended that it be ended information obtained from fingerprints flight manifests travel and identification documents and intelligence sources is more valuable in determining who poses a potential national security risk the report said citing customs and border control officers leaving the regulatory structure of the nseers program in place provides no discernible public benefit the report said the regulations that are being undone date to 1991 at the time of the first gulf war when immigration authorities began requiring the registration and fingerprinting of certain nonimmigrant travelers entering the united states from iraq and kuwait the authorities removed the requirements for those countries two years later but retained provisions preserving the attorney generals power to compel the same information from nonimmigrants from specific countries in 2002 the federal government began the program and required special registration from those arriving from iraq iran libya sudan and syria by 2003 the list had expanded to 25 countries most with majority muslim populations and most in africa and the middle east a decade after the sept 11 attacks the department of homeland security which had taken over the program said it had stopped registering arrivals from the designated countries and removed all countries from the list but the move left in place the regulations that allowed for it to be restarted in recent days dozens of democratic officials in washington as well as the new york state attorney general eric t schneiderman have called for the regulations to be rescinded no known terrorism convictions have resulted from the program read a joint letter dated dec 1 from more than 50 democratic members of the house of representatives mr schneiderman a democrat and a vocal opponent of mr trump said the program was an affront to our core american values of pluralism and equal justice under law facebook microsoft google and apple are among several technology companies that have publicly stated that they would not assist the new administration in developing any program that would collect information that could be used by the government to track immigrants from muslim countries the technology companies took action after thousands of silicon valley engineers signed a pledge saying they stood in solidarity with muslim americans and immigrants and would not use their skills for the new administrations proposed data collection policies we refuse to build a database of people based on their constitutionally protected religious beliefs the engineers said in a statement mr hakim in his statement said the regulations had long since been replaced by automated systems and programs that were not in place at the start of the registry program which required in person interviews by federal agents and targeted specific countries the new tools are far better equipped to face the evolving landscape of international terrorism he said those programs include an automated system for collecting and storing biometric data such as fingerprints from nearly all people entering the country the changes are set to take effect immediately after they are published on

mountain view calif in a meeting at google in 2004 the discussion turned to an e mail message the company had received from a fan in south korea sergey brin a google founder ran the message through an automatic translation service that the company had licensed the message said google was a favorite search engine but the result read the sliced raw fish shoes it wishes google green onion thing mr brin said google ought to be able to do better six years later its free google translate service handles 52 languages more than any similar system and people use it hundreds of millions of times a week to translate web pages and other text what you see on google translate is state of the art in computer translations that are not limited to a particular subject area said alon lavie an associate research professor in the language technologies institute at carnegie mellon university googles efforts to expand beyond searching the web have met with mixed success its digital books project has been hung up in court and the introduction of its social network buzz raised privacy fears the pattern suggests that it can sometimes misstep when it tries to challenge business traditions and cultural conventions but googles quick rise to the top echelons of the translation business is a reminder of what can happen when google unleashes its brute force computing power on complex problems the network of data centers that it built for web searches may now be when lashed together the worlds largest computer google is using that machine to push the limits on translation technology last month for example it said it was working to combine its translation tool with image analysis allowing a person to say take a cellphone photo of a menu in german and get an instant english translation machine translation is one of the best examples that shows googles strategic vision said tim oreilly founder and chief executive of the technology publisher oreilly media it is not something that anyone else is taking very seriously but google understands something about data that nobody else understands and it is willing to make the investments necessary to tackle these kinds of complex problems ahead of the market creating a translation machine has long been seen as one of the toughest challenges in artificial intelligence for decades computer scientists tried using a rules based approach teaching the computer the linguistic rules of two languages and giving it the necessary dictionaries but in the mid 1990s researchers began favoring a so called statistical approach they found that if they fed the computer thousands or millions of passages and their human generated translations it could learn to make accurate guesses about how to translate new texts it turns out that this technique which requires huge amounts of data and lots of computing horsepower is right up googles alley our infrastructure is very well suited to this vic gundotra a vice president for engineering at google said we can take approaches that others cant even dream of automated translation systems are far from perfect and even googles will not put human translators out of a job anytime soon experts say it is exceedingly difficult for a computer to break a sentence into parts then translate and reassemble them but googles service is good enough to convey the essence of a news article and it has become a quick source for translations for millions of people if you need a rough and ready translation its the place to go said philip resnik a machine translation expert and associate professor of linguistics at the university of maryland college park like its rivals in the field most notably microsoft and i b m google has fed its translation engine with transcripts of united nations proceedings which are translated by humans into six languages and those of the european parliament which are translated into 23 this raw material is used to train systems for the most common languages but google has scoured the text of the web as well as data from its book scanning project and other sources to move beyond those languages for more obscure languages it has released a tool kit that helps users with translations and then adds those texts to its database googles offering could put a dent in sales of corporate translation software from companies like i b m but automated translation is never likely to be a big moneymaker at least not by the standards of googles advertising business still googles efforts could pay off in several ways because googles ads are ubiquitous online anything that makes it easier for people to use the web benefits the company and the system could lead to interesting new applications last week the company said it would use speech recognition to generate captions for english language youtube videos which could then be translated into 50 other languages this technology can make the language barrier go away said franz och a principal scientist at google who leads the companys machine translation team it would allow anyone to communicate with anyone else mr och a german researcher who previously worked at the university of southern california said he was initially reluctant to join google fearing it would treat translation as a side project larry page googles other founder called to reassure him he basically said that this is something that is very important for google mr och recalled recently mr och signed on in 2004 and was soon able to put mr pages promise to the test while many translation systems like googles use up to a billion words of text to create a model of a language google went much bigger a few hundred billion english words the models become better and better the more text you process mr och said the effort paid off a year later google won a government run competition that tests sophisticated translation systems google has used a similar approach immense computing power heaps of data and statistics to tackle other complex problems in 2007 for example it began offering 800 goog 411 a free directory assistance service that interprets spoken requests it allowed google to collect the voices of millions of people so it could get better at recognizing spoken english a year later google released a search by voice system that was as good as those that took other companies years to build and late last year google introduced a service called goggles that analyzes cellphone photos matching them to a database of more than a billion online images including photos of streets taken for its street view service mr och acknowledged that googles translation system still needed improvement but he said it was getting better fast the current quality improvement curve is still pretty steep he said

san francisco one recent afternoon the citys newest grocery market was trying to figure out whether i would buy steal or leave behind a bag of white cheddar popcorn and so was i on its side 27 cameras along the ceiling and a wealth of behavioral data on my side crippling indecision last week san francisco got its first completely automated cashierless store standard market shoppers who have downloaded the stores app can go into the 1 900 square foot space grab items and simply leave there is no check in gate and there is no checkout swipe ceiling cameras identify the shopper and the items and determine when said items leave with said shopper or at least thats the idea the start up behind this operation is standard cognition which has raised 11 2 million in venture capital and formed partnerships with four retail chains around the world this first market is a prototype to showcase the technology and work on the bugs the ambitious goal is to add the tech in 100 stores a day each day by 2020 five of the seven founders came from the securities and exchange commission where they built artificial intelligence software to detect fraud and trade violations before starting standard cognition in 2017 now these fraud experts are working to discern something equally complicated whether i am stealing a snack standard market is the latest entry in the emerging fray of retail automation where companies are throwing cameras sensors and machine learning into grocery stores to replace the checkout line in january amazon opened its first cashierless go market in seattle to the public it has since opened more of the stores in china experiments in cashierless stores abound using radio frequency identification tags and a self checkout process that involves scanning a quick response code or your face standard cognitions approach is different it relies exclusively on the ceiling cameras and artificial intelligence software to figure out what you are buying the cameras document shoppers movements speed stride length and gaze the store knows when i glance at a poster and for how long it knows if i slowed down grabbed a chocolate bar and put it back it knows if my body is facing the dried mangoes but my face is set on the popcorn and it knows or is trying to know when i am planning to steal the goal is to predict and prevent shoplifting because unlike amazons go stores which have a subway turnstile like gate for entry and exit standard market has an open door and the path is clear we learn behaviors of what it looks like to leave said michael suswal standard cognitions co founder and chief operating officer trajectory gaze and speed are especially useful for detecting theft he said adding if theyre going to steal their gait is larger and theyre looking at the door once the system decides it has detected potential theft behavior a store attendant will get a text and walk over for a polite conversation mr suswal said predicting theft requires a lot of data about shoppers much of which does not exist yet or at least no one is willing to give it to us he said so a few days before standard market opened standard cognition hired 100 actors to shop there for four hours in japan the team has worked with a convenience store chain whose name it has not disclosed in a very useful data collection effort standard cognition said that unlike facial recognition it did not collect biometric information a possibility that has troubled privacy experts watching the technology evolve the growth of cashierless technology could hurt the american labor force there are nearly five million retail sales workers in america but as mr suswal has pitched standard cognitions technology he said he has found that most shop owners are not looking to replace workers instead they want their workers wandering the stores more in hopes of luring shoppers back into brick and mortar retail they all talk about new services making shopping more fun making it worthwhile to shop offline mr suswal said and they talk about data while a store owner can look at receipts to see who bought a generic ketchup cashierless technology can help tell if the shopper first picked up a heinz bottle and how long he or she looked at it basically now an owner can see what a customer did not buy on a recent friday a line stretched down the street from standard market as a bouncer at the door took in one shopper at a time for the automated experience the store is in san franciscos gentrifying mid market neighborhood between chanvi eatery a pakistani restaurant and huckleberry bicycles a high end bike shop people outside were downloading the app and typing in their credit card numbers walking out was yoshimasa takahashi 32 who works nearby in finance a receipt popped up on his phone it said he had bought noodles and kraft macaroni cheese except he had not bought the kraft macaroni cheese i was playing with it but didnt take it out mr takahashi said smiling at his win over the tech the bouncer gave him a refund inside rebecca schiffman 28 was working the floor she had been an employee at whole foods when the standard cognition team recruited her she liked the idea of getting out from behind a cash register and said she was unfazed about having to intervene with potential shoplifters i used to do that all the time anyway she said store hours are short for the next few weeks the store will be open only half days on wednesdays and fridays while the tech is tweaked for now the selection of food is extremely limited the store has only 25 square feet devoted to food because the founders said they have not yet gotten the permits required for more so there is an odd assortment of items fritos apple jacks and starbucks frappuccinos that leans heavily toward dorm room style snacks to shop i opened my phone which flashed blue letting the store know i had entered i wandered throwing items into my tote then i left outside i found mr suswal a minute went by and a notification popped up on my phone with my receipt one white cheddar popcorn and one roll of toilet paper for a total of 1 19 in fact i had left with two bags of popcorn i had toyed with the second bag debated buying it considered my dinner plans put it back and finally took it with a quick impulsive grab the system missed it that shouldnt happen mr suswal said and yet it did he shrugged and said i had won it so i left with the extra 99 cent bag of popcorn and i did not feel bad really soon standard cognition and others will probably get better will perfectly detect where that snack went and my movement will be subsumed and predicted by artificial intelligences endless data maw but for now its not quite good enough and i m covered in crumbs interested in all

seattle phone swindles are practically as old as the telephone itself but new technology has led to an onslaught of internet inspired fraud tactics that try to use telephone calls to dupe millions of people or to overwhelm switchboards for essential public services causing deep concern among law enforcement and other groups people businesses and government agencies across the country are combating the new schemes in which scammers use the internet to send huge volumes of calls at the same time many of the attacks bombard individuals with automated requests for personal data in a variation of their email scam cousins but others are more vicious flooding entire phone systems when demands are not met similar to some attacks against websites you can blast out 100 million calls from the comfort of your keyboard said kati daffan a lawyer in the bureau of consumer protection at the federal trade commission in october the department of homeland security advised federal agencies local governments and other organizations to be prepared for so called denial of service attacks which flood phone systems with calls making them unusable by legitimate callers the warning came after attacks against a sheriffs office in the southern united states and another against a coast guard cutter the department said there had been over 200 such attacks identified against public sector groups as they are for most forms of internet fraud the latest phone schemes are also difficult to track and investigate because of their frequency their layers of anonymity and their global nature several investigators could not name a successful prosecution of the latest wave of phone swindles though cybercriminals who committed other forms of fraud have been arrested in tarrant county tex the phone lines of several emergency dispatch centers were disabled in the last year because of a surge of automated calls said wanda s mccarley director of operations for the tarrant county 911 district which includes fort worth the attacks lasted up to an hour and were aimed at 10 digit phone emergency numbers at the centers which are accessible to callers outside the area rather than 911 lines which are not something similar happened to a texas hospital two years ago when an intensive care units phone lines were disabled for about six hours said the chief information officer for the hospital chain that owns the facility who spoke on the condition that he not be named to avoid unwanted attention for his employer to defend itself the hospital started using a service from securelogix a telephone security company which the hospitals chief information officer said had been effective in both cases employees at the facilities were contacted by callers who said they were debt collectors seeking repayment of loans taken out by the workers if the employees did not pay up the callers threatened the lines at the employees workplaces would be brought down the attackers then overwhelmed the lines with repeated calls causing busy signals for legitimate callers it is not clear how or why the specific employees were chosen though law enforcement officials believe that swindlers in such cases may find names on public staff directories or professional sites like linkedin some pay up in such swindles often out of uncertainty about whether they owe the money or to avoid embarrassment at their workplaces law enforcement officials said ralph a gagliardi agent in charge with the colorado bureau of investigations identity theft and mortgage fraud units said he traced payments from the victim in one such attack in colorado to nigeria via an intermediary in florida michael j mckeown supervisory special agent for the federal bureau of investigation in pittsburgh said if people do pay that makes their problems stop but it may make it more lucrative for people to do this for years government officials have warned the public of email frauds that request personal information known as phishing over time the public education has made it harder to trick people over email but there has been less public outreach about similar new types of phone schemes sometimes called vishing these more traditional swindles which ask individual recipients to provide personal or financial information appear to be up sharply as well in 2012 the federal trade commission said telephone calls accounted for 34 percent of the fraud complaints it received from people who reported how they had been contacted up from 20 percent in 2010 phone fraud was second only to email which accounted for 38 percent of complaints in 2012 automatic dialing software and internet phone services make it easy to place huge volumes of calls from anywhere in the world often swindlers create messages in a synthesized voice and say they are from a financial institution the call prompts the recipients to enter personal data through their phone keypads because making phone calls over the internet is so inexpensive the practice can be lucrative even if only a tiny percentage of the people provide information personal financial data obtained this way can be easily sold on the black market financial and government officials say it is unclear how much money is lost to such schemes jimmy forester of portland ore is one person who didnt fall for a phone swindle a message he received a few weeks ago told him his credit card needed to be reactivated and asked him to enter his account information instead he punched in random numbers because he was curious to see the fraudulent call through to its end fake emails are usually pretty easy to spot because you can look and see if it came from bank of america or from freeemailaddressinegypt com said mr forester 29 who is an electrician with the phone you dont have that option of researching banks have begun warning their customers to avoid providing any personal data through their phones when they receive such a call officials worry that the new threats are particularly effective against older americans who use phones more than computers and who seem to be more trusting some of these people are so darned convincing said debbie matz chairwoman of the national credit union administration the agency that regulates federal credit unions mr gagliardi began receiving complaints in colorado last fall in a case that illustrates how phone frauds can ripple across the country residents were receiving calls saying that their cellphone or bank accounts were compromised and that they needed to provide credit card information the deceptions did not end there the swindler used software to make the calls look as if they were originating from a law firm in palo alto calif many people called the firm to complain and they were directed to call the local police department instead the police department as a result was swamped with more than 2 000 phone calls over several days causing busy signals for other callers people have gotten trained now that you dont just click on random stuff in email said henning schulzrinne the chief technologist with the federal communications commission people dont necessarily understand how nontrustworthy caller id has become

times insider delivers behind the scenes insights into how news features and opinion come together at the new york times i moved from washington to chicago in 2016 because i thought it would improve my reporting on workers i joked to bewildered colleagues and sources that covering labor from washington was a bit like covering technology from washington by the time the political class gets wind of a story its been percolating in the economy for years at the time though i didnt fully appreciate the extent to which labor reporting is in effect technology reporting from automation and motivational games to workplace surveillance new technology is essential to the work lives of most americans i often spend more time trying to figure out the machines than figuring out the humans for example i spent the past few months on an article about artificial intelligence and the fashion industry i saw it partly as a labor story since computers are beginning to displace white collar workers in that field and many others but it was also an excuse to learn about a technology i only dimly understood i investigated algorithms that could prompt sales agents cyrano de bergerac style with the right turn of phrase at just the right moment and others that were capable of designing parts for appliances cars and airplanes in may i was at bombfell a fashion start up in new york getting styled by will noguchi who selects clothing for customers mr noguchi and his algorithms immediately pegged me for what i am a schlub with deeply conservative fashion sensibilities and gently eased me toward the 21st century part of my comfort zone so this is definitely one that i would go with the algorithm here he said pointing to a johnnie o t shirt that the software had recommended still in my more than three years on the beat ive found that a lot of what we think of as shiny and new has familiar roots theres perhaps no better example than the so called gig economy in which workers perform tasks on demand not just ferrying around people and food but also assembling furniture tagging photos rewriting blog content and generally get paid by the task or for a few hours at a time rather than earn a steady wage admirers hail it as a job market in which workers are finally in control of their own destinies but the gig economy can also be thought of as an elaborate way around an age old problem how to control workers without the expense of making them employees and without breaking the law take the ride hailing services uber and lyft which argue that their drivers are independent business owners not employees in large part because the drivers control when where and how long they work what they dont tell you is that the apps that govern their drivers work lives rely on a variety of incentives games design features and outright manipulations to influence the when the where and the how long for example both apps dispatch new rides to a driver before he or she has finished the current ride in the same way that automatic queuing on netflix appears to encourage binge watching this feature appears to encourage a kind of binge driving uber and lyft say the feature helps drivers by reducing idle time and while technology may be creating new ways of organizing work that doesnt mean we need to rethink the rights and protections workers deserve its become fashionable in the tech world to argue that we need a third way to classify workers who arent obviously employees and arent obviously independent contractors and that this third way should afford them some but not all the protections of employment but if you talk to enough gig economy entrepreneurs about their businesses you begin to have doubts in 2013 about two years after it started an on demand food preparation and delivery service called munchery converted its drivers from contractors to employees while the move cost about 20 to 30 percent more upfront the benefits of being able to summon forth enough drivers during periods of high demand made it a better deal for the company in the end so did the lower turnover and increased quality control the essential facts of the gig economy though can be hard to see through the hype that often clouds tech reporting when i stepped off the elevator into lyfts headquarters in the fall of 2016 the techno music was throbbing there were vast concrete floors and some de rigueur ductwork and the lobby was painted in striking shades of pink and purple the companys signature colors that was where i had to sign in as it happened signing in meant entering information on a tablet screen that gradually morphed into a nondisclosure agreement a fixture of office visits across the bay area in recent years i precipitated a minor uproar by refusing to sign but was eventually waved in nonetheless lyft says it doesnt require reporters to sign my times colleagues dont sign either you can see how this might be subtly corrupting you begin to think if they want me to sign a nondisclosure agreement there must be something transcendent going on here only later do you suspect its as much a status symbol as a security precaution the silicon valley equivalent of a line outside a club there is no better antidote to this than data for years my colleagues and i assumed that the gig economy was growing rapidly or at least that the share of workers in alternative freelance type arrangements was in fairness there was credible evidence that this was true but a recent labor department survey cast a lot of doubt on this claim were still trying to adjust our superlatives when theres no government data to speak of you sometimes have to round up your own numbers guerrilla style last year i spent several weeks going back and forth with uber about whether it had improperly deducted hundreds of millions of dollars in sales taxes from drivers pay in the end the only way to resolve the question was to collect as many receipts from as many cities as possible and do the math myself a friend of a friend sent receipts from rhode island we hired a stringer to forward receipts from nevada while gig economy reporting may be prone to overstatement theres another part of the beat that tends to get shorter shrift the rights of workers including the right to organize courts have increasingly limited those rights of late and thanks to consolidation automation and outsourcing much of it either driven or enabled by technology there are vanishingly few workers who have enough market power to face down their employers alone its a power dynamic that most workers dont fully appreciate until they face a crisis in 2015 i went to oregon to write about a group of hospital doctors whose employer had proposed outsourcing management of their group out of desperation they formed a union killed the outsourcing idea and eventually beat back pressure to get them to see more patients which they considered unsafe imagine mr burns sitting across the table one of the doctors rajeev alexander told me comparing the experience to negotiating with the notorious simpsons character it was the absolute right thing we wouldnt be here today without unionizing brittany ellison one of the doctors told me at the time these were highly paid professionals almost universally esteemed in the eyes of the public and yet they still felt as powerless as people at the other end of the economic spectrum we were trained to be leaders ms ellison said but they treat us like assembly line workers credit noam scheiber

as i zipped up the west side highway the other day in a gleaming red tesla model 3 i found myself wondering are american drivers ready for autopilot autopilot is teslas enhanced driver assistance technology which the company maintains is the most advanced system available tesla says all its vehicles have the hardware needed for full self driving capability at a safety level substantially greater than that of a human driver in this case i was the human i had tried a gull wing model x last fall with an earlier version of autopilot but since then the stakes for both tesla and consumers have soared on march 23 a driver was killed in mountain view calif after a model x crashed into a concrete highway divider while autopilot was in use the fatal accident attracted intense media coverage and sent tesla stock long an investor favorite into a nose dive four days later moodys downgraded teslas debt from stable to negative tesla was already so plagued with model 3 production delays that its chief executive elon musk said he had been sleeping on the factory floor by the beginning of this past week tesla shares had dropped over 30 percent from a peak of almost 390 a share last summer despite this wave of negative publicity it seems clear that tesla will rise or fall based on the performance safety design and value of its cars if it gets those things right all the other issues will sort themselves out tesla has already defied skeptics and attracted legions of die hard fans by surmounting seemingly impossible odds to build all electric cars that have drawn lavish praise from automotive critics that includes the model 3 which popular mechanics named its 2018 car of the year it was a finalist for motor trends similar award that it lost out to the alfa romeo giulia has drawn howls of online protest when my model 3 test vehicle pulled up to the curb on eighth avenue it didnt quite stop pedestrian traffic the way opening the gull wing doors on the model x had but i could see why the automotive press is so excited the interior features a single slab of wood sweeping around the cockpit interrupted only by a touch screen interface that houses nearly all the controls many of them voice activated with its zen minimalism it doesnt look or feel like any other car ive been in the synthetic leather seats are comfortable and theres ample room for someone my size 6 foot 3 this all comes at a cost 57 500 for this luxurious long range version far from the 35 000 base price that has excited many potential tesla buyers the model 3 may not have the rocketlike acceleration of the x but i found it nimble and responsive i easily accelerated from a full stop into traffic flowing at highway speed usually a nerve racking maneuver in a conventional car driving the model 3 was such a pleasure i was reluctant to cede any control to autopilot for someone with decades of experience driving a conventional car my first taste of semiautonomous driving last fall had come as a shock the sensation of a vehicle moving on its own was so bizarre that i instinctively gripped the steering wheel which immediately transferred control back to me this time i was more relaxed willing to see how the car would behave i gave the voice activated navigation system a destination garden state plaza a new jersey shopping mall about 20 miles away and the car accelerated braked stayed in the center of the lane and maintained a comfortable three car distance ahead of me all without my intervention at the mall it detected an empty parking place and flawlessly backed into it one of its most impressive features is the ability for the driver to change lanes simply by pressing the turn signal lever the tesla scans for traffic in the adjacent lane waits for an opening and then glides into place eliminating the danger of a blind spot over the years ive experienced several close calls involving lane changes and blind spots although id been briefed on its limitations so successful was autopilot that i was tempted to let down my guard by not bothering to look in the rearview mirror that would have been a mistake for all its vision capabilities including in darkness autopilot became confused when lanes werent clearly marked or split in two or at exit ramps you cant simply program the destination and let the car find its way its reassuringly cautious about changing lanes but in heavy traffic i would have missed an exit while waiting for it to find a suitable opening and had to assert manual control while heading south on the new jersey turnpike i could see in the rearview mirror a bmw bearing down at high speed i pushed the turn signal for a lane change and despite its ultrasonic sensors the tesla seemed oblivious to the onrushing car it started to move into its lane the driver laid on his horn and i had to grab control to avoid an accident blog posts indicate that other drivers have experienced the same issue the tesla owners manual describes this situation as one that the system cant yet manage tesla said it expected future upgrades to solve the problem but for now drivers need to be as attentive to the rearview mirror as with any other car tesla had no comment for this column at this juncture autopilot is a misnomer as many others have observed this is not self driving technology said bryan reimer a research scientist and expert on autonomous vehicle technology at the massachusetts institute of technology its a collaborative system that leaves responsibility for safety in the drivers hands and isnt intended to let them sit in the back seat or pursue other activities while driving even though some companies have said they plan driverless ride services in as little as two years mr reimer said full automation was likely to be many years or even decades in the future self driving automation systems are ranked from zero no automation to 5 full automation teslas autopilot is level 2 it requires drivers to keep at least one hand on the wheel the car issues a prompt if it doesnt detect a hand on the wheel and autopilot shuts down if theres no response in the mountain view accident tesla has said the driver received several visual and one audible hands on warning but the drivers hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision given that this was my first extended drive using autopilot i was hypervigilant maybe even more so than in a conventional car im told that wears off in time as using autopilot becomes second nature the risk is that complacency contributes to driver inattention mr reimer and other experts are conducting research into the issue as technology supplants human performance mr reimer said the bigger question is how safe is safe enough if lane changing technology is 50 percent more effective than humans is that good enough thats the big question no one wants to answer at the same time he said he worries that intense media coverage of accidents like mountain view will scare people off he said it was too soon to draw any conclusions from that fatality but noted that teslas excellent safety record over the many millions of miles its cars have now traveled suggested that using autopilot cant be substantially more risky than conventional controls there were more than 40 000 traffic fatalities in the united states last year after investigating a fatal 2016 crash involving a tesla s and a tractor trailer in florida the national highway transportation safety administration found no flaws in the autopilot system the national transportation safety board concluded that autopilot had performed as intended but that the driver had become overly reliant on the technology after my drive in the model 3 my sense is that even with its flaws teslas autopilot is a vast improvement over conventional controls and enhances rather than supplants the driving experience im tempted to join the model 3 waiting list which numbers over 400 000 customers investors too seem to have reassessed teslas recent bad news this past week tesla said it had succeeded in ramping up production of the model 3 though it still fell short of targets and had adequate capital for the rest of the year from monday morning through the end of trading thursday tesla shares jumped more than 24 percent credit james b stewart

its a freezing snowy day on the border between estonia and russia soldiers from the two nations are on routine border patrol each side accompanied by an autonomous weapon system a tracked robot armed with a machine gun and an optical system that can identify threats like people or vehicles as the patrols converge on uneven ground an estonian soldier trips and accidentally discharges his assault rifle the russian robot records the gunshots and instantaneously determines the appropriate response to what it interprets as an attack in less than a second both the estonian and russian robots commanded by algorithms turn their weapons on the human targets and fire when the shooting stops a dozen dead or injured soldiers lie scattered around their companion machines leaving both nations to sift through the wreckage or blame the other side for the attack the hypothetical scenario seems fantastical but those battlefield robots already exist today in an early form milrem robotics a company based in estonia has developed a robot called themis tracked hybrid modular infantry system which consists of a mobile body mounted on small tank treads topped with a remote weapon turret that can be equipped with small or large caliber machine guns it also includes cameras and target tracking software so the turret can pursue people or objects as programmed this is a human controlled system for now and milrem for its part insists that it will remain that way but the components are there for a robot that can interpret what it sees identify likely combatants and target them all on its own the possible uses for the themis the robots builders gush on the website are almost limitless sign up for the weekly at war newsletter to receive stories about duty conflict and consequence the decision to use a lethal weapon in battle against combatants has always been a decision made by a human being that may soon change modern advancements in artificial intelligence machine image recognition and robotics have poised some of the worlds largest militaries on the edge of a new future where weapon systems may find and kill people on the battlefield without human involvement russia china and the united states are all working on autonomous platforms that pair weapons with sensors and targeting computers britain and israel are already using weapons with autonomous characteristics missiles and drones that can seek and attack an adversarys radar vehicle or ship without a human command triggering the immediate decision to fire under what circumstances can and should militaries delegate the decision to take a human life to machines its a moral leap that has raised fundamental questions about the nature of warfare and that military planners human rights organizations defense officials research analysts and ethicists have yet to reach a consensus on how new is this technology the technology for weapons systems to identify and acquire targets independently has existed in basic form for several decades in the 1980s and 90s united states war planners experimented with harpoon and tomahawk missiles that could identify targets independently both are in use today albeit with human oversight the most advanced automated american weaponry has focused on defensive applications when rocket and mortar attacks threatened large american bases in iraq in 2003 the army developed the counter rocket artillery and mortar system c ram a rapid fire 20 mm cannon that can identify an incoming airborne threat alert a human operator and with the operators press of a button track and destroy it with a burst of special ammunition that self destructs in midair to minimize damage to friendly personnel or civilians below those weapons were based on a naval gun system the phalanx thats considered a last line of defense against antiship missiles the phalanx was just one of the navys automated answers to late cold war pressures soviet naval doctrine relied on overwhelming enemy ship squadrons with as many as 60 cruise missiles at a time when large salvos come in its impossible for humans to be able to say o k youve got to take this missile out first says robert work a senior fellow at the center for a new american security in washington there was no way for humans in the combat information center to be able to keep up with that so american planners developed phalanx and the aegis combat system which links sensors on fleet ships and aircraft to identify airborne threats and with operator input automatically attack them with shipboard missiles it was programmed work says to have a totally automatic setting and literally the human at some point pushes the button and the machine makes all the decisions how would autonomous weapons systems work it depends on how autonomous they are theres a type of fire and forget weapon where the weapon itself decides o k this is what i see happening in the battlefield and i think im going to have to take out this particular tank because i think this tank is the command tank says work this is his definition of a true lethal autonomous weapon system an independent weapon that decides everything about who and what it destroys once a human has unleashed it as deputy secretary of defense between 2014 and 2017 work was responsible for carrying out the pentagons third offset strategy a plan to counter potential adversaries numerical advantages by putting innovative technologies at the core of united states military doctrine the united states first offset in president eisenhowers day built on americas nuclear advantage a second offset in the 1970s and 80s emphasized the nations advances in computers and missile guidance technology for work the third offset meant leveraging artificial intelligence and machine autonomy to create a smarter faster network integrating humans and machines it also meant watching how other states and nonstate actors developed their own autonomous capabilities from expendable unmanned aerial vehicles to tanks or missile batteries augmented by artificial intelligence what types of systems are the united states focused on right now darpa the defense advanced research projects agency has a program called code or collaborative operations in denied environment to design sophisticated software that will allow groups of drones to work in closely coordinated teams even in places where the enemy has been able to deny american forces access to gps and other satellite based communications code is not intended to create autonomous weapons says paul scharre author of army of none autonomous weapons and the future of war but rather adapting to a world where well have groups of robots operating collaboratively together under one person in supervisory control the program manager has compared it to wolves hunting in coordinated packs codes human operators monitor the swarm without micromanaging it and the autonomy of the drones means that they are programmed to improvise and adjust as they pursue their preset mission the idea here is that code is going after mobile or rapidly relocatable targets so the target locations cannot be specified precisely in advance by humans scharre says its not like a tomahawk cruise missile where you just program in the coordinates and then the missile goes and strikes it the drones have to be able to search an area and find targets on the move a simpler autonomous system is the loitering munition a drone that can fly for some time on its own looking for specific signals before finding a target and crashing into it with an explosive payload israel produces a loitering munition dubbed the harpy which is designed to hunt out and destroy enemy radar stations and which became a sticking point in u s israeli relations when some were sold to china in the late 1990s companies in several nations including slovakia and the united states have also produced loitering munitions what is the argument in favor of weapons that are lethal and independent imagine that we are fighting in a city and we have a foe that is using human life indiscriminately as a human shield says tony cerri who until recently oversaw data science models and simulations at the u s army training and doctrine command its constantly in your face as youre out walking in the street you cant deal with every situation you are going to make a mistake autonomous weapons he suggests are much less likely to make such mistakes a robot operating with milliseconds looking at data that you cant even begin to conceive is going to say this is the right time to use this kind of weapon to limit collateral damage this argument parallels the controversial case for self driving cars in both instances sensor rich machines navigate a complex environment without the fatigue distractions and other human fallibilities that can lead to fatal mistakes yet both arguments discount the emergent behaviors that can come from increasingly intelligent machines interpreting the world differently from humans in autonomous cars those new behaviors have already had deadly consequences like when a tesla model s in autopilot mode in florida failed to recognize a tractor trailer crossing the highway ahead and drove under it killing the cars owner that crash in 2016 was the first of two fatal accidents on highways in the united states involving a tesla on autopilot uber temporarily pulled its own self driving cars from the roads last march when one killed a pedestrian walking her bike across a street in arizona what are the arguments for limiting the decision making of autonomous weapons systems even advocates concede that autonomous military robots could behave in new and unforeseen ways inducing new errors the way trading algorithms unleashed on the stock market can cause flash crashes or a pair of dueling book resellers algorithms on amazon could end up pricing a 70 biology text at 23 million which happened in 2011 those possibilities and the danger that lethal machine errors could precipitate bloodier conflicts will require close cooperative measures between robot armed nations delegations to the united nations have begun discussions on regulating lethal autonomous weapon systems under an existing convention on certain conventional weapons which governs things ranging from booby traps to blinding lasers in august a united nations working group set down principles that could be used to guide future international regulations on lethal autonomy chief among them is the idea of ensuring human responsibility for any weapon throughout its life cycle which could create new liabilities for arms manufacturers the united nations group is set to release a formal report with recommendations for future action this month besides governments the groups meetings attract their share of activists like mary wareham of human rights watch who is the global coordinator for the campaign to stop killer robots an initiative launched in 2013 with the explicit mission of keeping humans in charge of lethal decisions in war weve focused on two things that we want to see remain under meaningful or appropriate or adequate or necessary human control wareham says thats the identification and selection of targets and then the use of force against them lethal or otherwise those are the key decision points critics say where only a humans judgment capable of discriminating between enemies and civilians and keeping a sense of proportionality in responding can be accountable and satisfy the conventions of war is it morally acceptable to delegate decisions of life and death to robots the way in which we tend to justify war or condemn certain acts has to do with the fact that human beings are making decisions that are either moral or immoral says pauline shanks kaurin a professor specializing in military ethics at the u s naval war college if humans arent making those decisions if its literally machines against machines then it seems like then its something else right its the ways in which robotic firepower can be harnessed by humans that have spurred some of autonomous weaponrys sharpest critics in 2015 steve wozniak and elon musk along with stephen hawking and more than 1 000 robotics and artificial intelligence researchers signed an open letter warning that autonomous weapons will become the kalashnikovs of the future ideal for tasks such as assassinations destabilizing nations subduing populations and selectively killing a particular ethnic group google which had several of its senior artificial intelligence researchers among the letters signatories published a statement of its own principles on artificial intelligence in june 2018 including an outright refusal to develop weapons or other technologies whose principal purpose or implementation is to cause or directly facilitate injury to people for work the question of morality might come down to americas adversaries there may be a place and time in the future where were up against an opponent who is less worried about delegating lethal authority to a machine he says but thats a long way off and we have a lot of time to think about that and a lot of time to take action and make sure that we can still control all the weapons credit kelsey d atherton

the next decade looks good for travel agents private detectives and subway operators but don t even think about becoming a butcher watchmaker or ship fitter so says the federal bureau of labor statistics which periodically borrows a standard commercial computer model of the economy massages the numbers a bit and then grinds out predictions of where the jobs will be the 25 fastest growing job categories to the year 2005 along with the 25 fastest shrinking ones are displayed here for your edification as a soothsayer the bureau is distinctly fallible too much after all turns on imponderables like the rate of military spending and the federal reserve s ability to keep the economy out of recession still uncle sam s educated guesses offer some striking insights into the ways business is trying to squeeze more value from fewer dollars paid to labor as might be expected virtually every unskilled or semiskilled job linked to manufacturing is a loser manufacturing output will continue to grow said ronald kutscher associate commissioner of the bureau of labor statistics but productivity is rising more rapidly than demand undermining employment in several categories from tire makers to printers to a catch all called packing and filling machine operators by the same token jobs most vulnerable to imports those requiring a lot of semiskilled labor to add value will likely be a drag on the market it wasn t much fun being an american shoe or apparel worker in competition with asian and latin workers over the last decade and it will probably be even less fun in the next but other predicted changes catch subtler trends the number of child care workers over all is expected to rise by more than 60 percent by the year 2005 as more mothers with young children go back to work sooner the number of legal child care workers in private households however is expected to decline as servants become an ever less affordable luxury this seemingly paradoxical trend is mirrored in other personal services private cooks and maids are apparently an endangered species as demand shifts to restaurant cooks bakers manicurists bellhops and laundry and dry cleaning workers technology and changing tastes produce a host of similar double plays the number of farmers will continue to decline as agricultural productivity grows relentlessly while the number of nursery farm workers will increase with the demand for garden plants and specialized farm crops the entertainment industry is booming opening jobs for producers directors actors and amusement park attendants meanwhile film projectionists are succumbing to the automation of multiplex theaters the aging of the population more specifically the explosive growth in the number of americans over the age of 80 is driving demand for home care aides as well as the demand for most categories of health care workers but the pattern of job growth will be powerfully influenced by efforts to contain medical costs physical therapists dental hygienists medical secretaries registered nurses psychologists in short anyone who can reduce the work load on high priced physicians will be in demand what works for health care apparently works for the other expensive service that americans cannot seem to do without but do not wish to pay for legal representation legal secretaries and paralegals lawyers assistants are both in the top 25 job categories but lawyers are conspicuously absent perhaps most striking is the shuffle of jobs in industries dependent on electronics hundreds of thousands of jobs will disappear in telecommunications and office work as microprocessors and radio transmitters replace humans in directory assistance switchboard operations switching equipment maintenance telephone and cable television wiring bill posting word processing and data entry bank tellers might be on this list as the efficiency driven merger of the chase and chemical banks last week suggests they probably escape the bottom 25 only because the shift toward automated teller machines has already decimated their ranks on the other hand lots of new jobs will be created to aid in computer design and repair software innovation and computerized page layout for magazines and newspapers a caveat for those who would interpret the list as a guide to the best jobs while rapid growth in openings means it will be relatively easy to find work in the top 25 many of these jobs will be anything but nifty after all one reason so many are expected to be employed in service jobs like restaurant and home care is that the going wage rates will be low those with the talent ambition and training will still be better off fighting for the prizes in the highly paid professions graphs showing the biggest predicted job gains and declines heading into the next century

the strings of letters and numbers flashing on his computer screen were unintelligible to kishore parwani but he knew that each was the name of a computer program with hundreds or even thousands of lines of code he also knew something was wrong because the screen was telling him the code was free of year 2000 faults a result as believable as a report that a unicorn had won the kentucky derby the programs sent by one of the nation s largest commercial real estate companies for testing by data integrity inc had been certified as year 2000 ready by the large software company that created them but data integrity and other companies that review code to verify software claims typically find scores even hundreds of serious oversights our best clients still have 40 to 50 errors per millions of lines of code said richard e evans an analyst with meta group of stamford conn a consulting firm that provides information on verification tools and services half of those could corrupt data or crash systems that adds up to thousands of potentially serious flaws for banks insurance companies and others the government and most of corporate america have declared that virtually all of their critical systems will function normally when jan 1 arrives but because only a portion of most computer code is actually tested to make sure the year 00 will be correctly interpreted even the most confident computer managers anticipate at least minor flaws thus as the repairs and testing wind up year 2000 boils down to one pressing question since stamping out every year 2000 date problem is impossible has the caseload of miscalculations and crashes been reduced to manageable levels for the real estate company the mirage of clean code disappeared when mr parwani adjusted his scanning tactics for the obscure code in which the program was written a three day review of close to 2 5 million lines of the software vendor s supposedly year 2000 ready code identified about 250 flaws we found at least 10 flaws that would have required several days to fix said a programmer for the real estate company which allowed a reporter to observe the procedure on the condition that it not be identified they would not have stopped business but they might have interfered with things like tracking how long rents are overdue while true showstoppers rarely turn up in such inspections the number of flaws uncovered naturally raises questions about whether the government and many corporations are overstating their readiness the prevailing confidence is probably justified as far as the new year s weekend goes but the longer term picture is murkier according to verification tool providers like data integrity as with software flaws in general system crashes are usually less troublesome than malfunctions that generate faults not be immediately apparent less than 10 percent of the problems we find would cause something to stop said scott hilson director of technical support for reasoning inc a palo alto calif based rival of data integrity this is more like termites than an earthquake the year 2000 termites might be more dangerous than normal bugs because they are expected to peak in the first weeks of january when many computer workers are already stretched thin handling malfunctions that occur as the old year ends and the new one begins anywhere from 2 percent to 5 percent of computer jobs normally fail in late december and early january mr evans of meta group said that rate will more than double this year according to projections by the gartner group a technology consulting firm in stamford conn unfortunately thanks to the year 2000 challenge even the normal problems are likely to be more common in coming weeks in addition to the year 2000 flaws programmers will be wrestling with other errors inadvertently added to the code during repair efforts based on an examination of 30 years of software records capers jones chairman of software productivity research inc in burlington mass predicts that year 2000 workers have introduced 7 flaws for every 100 they fixed in addition many computer users bought new software to retire programs that had date problems but newly installed software tends to have more bugs than average nevertheless vendors like data integrity have found contracts harder to come by than analysts had originally projected sales for the automated tools the vendors provide have reached about 200 million the analysts estimate but more had been expected the tools are generally modified versions of programs that find and repair date flaws one of their strongest selling points beyond blazing speed is that they scan every line in a program by contrast although running test programs provides a better window on real world use such tests require intricate scripts and even complex simulations like those conducted by wall street in march and april can check only a small percentage of a large user s code most verification tools start with vast glossaries of all terms that might be used for dates in coding and for operations using them like tracking how many days a payment is overdue data integrity s approach is somewhat different it looks not for date terms but for coding that indicates a mathematical operation like compare it then tries to filter out commands that could not involve year 2000 errors but regardless of approach users generally pay for verification tools based on the number of lines of code that will be scanned rates generally run between 4 to 10 cents a line with a typical contract covering hundreds of thousands of lines at a minimum price can be a sticking point for some smaller organizations mr burgess said adding that data integrity s contracts have run from 90 000 to more than 2 million analysts estimate that the big computer users in the united states with comprehensive year 2000 programs have used either tools or human checks on 40 to 60 percent of their repaired code once you get outside the u s and a few countries you get down to single digits in how much of the code has been independently verified mr evans said the first generation of automated year 2000 tools in the mid 1990 s was difficult to use the tools frequently overwhelmed programmers with lists of potential glitches that on closer inspection had nothing to do with dates many computer users turned instead to so called body shops like i b m cap gemini and keane which relied more heavily on human programmers than automation for verifying code many of the tools now have better filters but programmers acquainted with how the code is used must still determine which of the flaws are worth investigating as data integrity s contract with the real estate company demonstrated the independent verification business has not dried up even though january is just around the corner but many prospective clients are suffering from y2k fatigue mr burgess said at the end of october they started saying it was too late to do anything more today the rooms in data integrity s office in a business park near route 128 outside boston are mostly empty but it is not because the company is shriveling as demand for its main product slows the office is a new one that the company moved into anticipating adding to its staff of 30 next year as its tools like those of its rivals are adapted to cleaning up other faults in software thanks to year 2000 they should get at least a chance to make pitches to most of the world s biggest computer users

the office has been gradually filling up with sophisticated electronic machinery word processors intelligent copiers printers and computers the next step is to connect the machines to each other using a local network most of the major office equipment vendors have developed or are believed to be developing their own local networks or are lining up behind the standard bearers in what is shaping up as the next big battle in the office automation industry local networks can greatly enhance the usefulness of office machinery alone a word processor can be used to type and edit a letter attached to a local network the word processor can transmit that letter to another word processor or computer terminal in the building several terminals can share the same printer or electronic filing cabinet local networks can also be attached to long distance transmission networks so that data can be sent between cities local networks are expected eventually to alleviate another stumbling block toward office automation the so called babel syndrome computers and word processors and other machines made by different companies speak different languages and use different formats imagine how the mail would work if some people wrote the address in french and others in german and some put the address in a spot on the envelope that others use for the return address ideally local networks will allow devices made by different vendors to be hooked together at the moment however it is widely perceived that the company that sells the local network will also sell most of the machines that attach to it that is where the money is to be made it s a cheap way of selling a lot of equipment at one time said dale kutnick of the yankee group a boston area consulting firm nevertheless some smaller companies such as sytek inc and ungermann bass inc are peddling only the communications function without having an interest in particular word processors or printers building a local network basically requires installing wires or cables in a building and devising a way to control the traffic on the cable or wires while that might sound simple there are numerous ways of accomplishing it each with different costs transmission speed and capabilities networks generally cost from 800 to 2 000 per attachment mr kutnick said one method is the baseband approach typified by the xerox corporation s ethernet which uses a coaxial cable that can carry only one packet of data at a time the various office machines attach to the cable at different points before putting a message into the cable a machine listens to make sure that the coast is clear if it is the message is sent in a lightning quick burst if two machines start sending at once and collide they both draw back and try again like two people who start talking to each other at the same time in ethernet the machines themselves control the traffic because it has only one pathway baseband cannot carry some types of information particularly television pictures wang s answer is broadband in which the cable is divided into multiple channels as in cable television to increase its carrying capacity the lowell mass company says its wangnet which will be announced formally in the next several months will have greater capacity for roughly the same price as baseband the yankee group however notes that there is an extra cost attached to the device that must assign each message to a given frequency xerox believes the ability to transmit television pictures is not needed still another approach is to have all the messages go through a central switchboard as in the telephone system the datapoint corporation earlier this month displayed a sophisticated switchboard or private branch exchange capable of handling both voice and data proponents of that approach say such a system is justified for phone use alone other approaches arrange the machines in rings machines either can be polled in turn by a central controller to see if they have any messages to submit or a token can be passed around the ring from machine to machine and each device can send a message when it controls the token which approach or approaches will prevail is far from clear the situation is complicated by the fact that more than one approach can be used within the same building datapoint for instance envisions using its central switchboard to connect various smaller baseband networks furthermore the international business machines corporation the largest office automation company has not yet fully played its hand

for much of the last two decades bankers advising big companies have watched ruefully as they lost their once dominant position on wall street to powerful traders now the pendulum is swinging back toward the deal makers the bankers working on mergers and acquisitions are expecting a nice bump in their bonuses this year while traders are bracing for their paychecks to shrink even beyond the short term many people in the industry are betting that the conditions that have recently favored bankers are not likely to go away soon the resurgence of the rainmakers is perhaps most evident in some recent prominent poaching in the industry jpmorgan chase lured dag skattum a high powered banker away from the private equity firm tpg last month to become vice chairman of the bank s operations in europe a few weeks before morgan stanley hired two energy bankers away from greenhill company a few years ago these sorts of announcements generally involved skilled bond or commodities traders the changes have also benefited bankers further down the totem pole where there has been fierce competition for young analysts and less interest in young traders there s a huge oversupply of quality traders and not very much demand said adam zoia founder of the recruiting firm glocap the shifts have been particularly telling at european banks barclays for instance put an old fashioned investment banker in charge of its wall street operation focusing on its work for clients and looking to automate and trim its trading desks traders are certainly not going away despite all the hand wringing the desks that buy and sell stocks and bonds still brought in 55 percent of the revenue at jpmorgan s giant investment bank in the first nine months of this year advisory work brought in a rather paltry 5 percent of the revenue the figures though are moving in opposite directions with advisory revenue up 35 percent from a year ago and trading revenue down 11 percent some of the explanations for these trends lie in the fleeting dynamics of the markets companies have been eager to make deals because of the steadily rising stock market the bull market has helped foster a calm trading environment that is not good for the people doing the buying and selling but the troubles facing traders go beyond these so called cyclical factors several broader shifts in the nature of the financial industry may be here to stay and these are frequently some of the same things that benefit the deal makers since the financial crisis for example regulators have required banks to protect against trading losses by setting aside capital proportional to the amount of trading a firm does that has significantly increased the costs involved in trading and shrunk the profitability but banks essentially do not have to hold capital for the business of advising companies allowing more of the revenue to flow through to employees the deal makers also do not need the bank to extend them money to do their work they just need a rolodex said steven g eckhaus a leading executive compensation lawyer at cadwalader wickersham taft the trading business is also becoming increasingly automated that took place years ago in the stock markets but it is now happening quickly in the bond and derivatives markets as well the computers doing the buying and selling make each trader more productive and profitable but fewer employees are needed to do the work and more of the revenue goes to pay for the computers and technological overhead the work of investment bankers by contrast is much more difficult to computerize that has provided a bit more job stability for the people who match up companies and negotiate the price of a merger or acquisition figures from coalition an industry data firm show that while the overall number of people working on fixed income trading desks at top banks shrank 10 percent this year from last year and 2 percent for people on stock trading desks the head count in traditional investment banking has shrunk only 1 percent in the past traders could leave for high paying jobs at hedge funds but now the trends outside the regulated banking industry look similar to those inside private equity firms which focus on buying and selling companies have been adding staff while hedge funds focused on trading have been stumbling but obtaining an investment banking job is not as easy as just declaring an interest in making deals advising companies requires an unusual combination of skills that can be hard to come by making the good investment bankers that much more valuable there aren t that many real deal makers out there mr eckhaus said the people who really attract the confidence of the large companies are few and far between this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print

livonia mich connie from livonia was on the line with representative thaddeus mccotter during a telephone town hall style meeting sounding worried as the auto industry continued to spiral down taking michigans economy along for the ride her husband was laid off from american axle and manufacturing one of the many suppliers cutting back because of the rapidly shrinking demand for parts her sons who had served in the military could not find work and were ineligible for veterans health care since mr mccotter had opposed the economic stimulus program just what was his plan she asked to deal with the increasingly dire situation that she and thousands of other mccotter constituents find themselves in mr mccotter a junior member of the house republican leadership ticked off some alternatives offered by republicans and stuck to his position that the 787 billion stimulus package presented an unacceptable trade of minimal near term benefits for future fiscal disaster it wont work said mr mccotter 43 who worked his way up from local elected office if i thought it would work i would have voted for it now mr mccotter whose suburban district west of detroit is laced with unemployed autoworkers shuttered automotive plants and struggling manufacturers could become a test case of whether house republicans united front against the economic measure was the wise political and policy course democrats are mounting a new campaign to remind voters that mr mccotter and 11 other republicans in competitive districts in harder hit states opposed the stimulus package which the president says will provide middle class tax cuts and millions of jobs 7 800 in mr mccotters district alone according to a calculation by the white house did you know congressman thad mccotter voted against president obamas economic recovery plan endorsed by the u s chamber of commerce says the script of an automated telephone call that the democratic congressional campaign committee plans to direct to homes in his district this week the message will encourage voters to call mr mccotter and ask why he voted to raise taxes on middle class families in an interview mr mccotter said his constituents understood that the legislation which increased unemployment benefits and subsidized health insurance for laid off workers could not fix the states structural economic problems he said they joined him in suspecting that significant amounts of the money would be wasted the people who really like the stimulus are the elected officials who will handle the money said mr mccotter an intense man and an amateur guitar player who has displayed photographs of the beatles and the rolling stones in his local offices during the telephone session with constituents last thursday some callers praised mr mccotters stance and encouraged him to keep up his fight many seemed much more anxious about whether the federal government would come through with more relief for the big three auto manufacturers aid that mr mccotter fervently supports republicans were emboldened in their opposition to the stimulus plan by their ability to successfully lampoon some provisions as frivolous and ineffective drawing extensive news coverage and plaudits from conservative commentators but recent independent polls have shown wide public support for the measure and disapproval of the republican approach some republicans have begun to emphasize benefits in the bill for their communities even though they voted against it in michigan democratic officials say the republican opposition is difficult to fathom given the deteriorating economic conditions in the state and the 18 billion michigan stands to receive the legislation also frees general motors from billions of dollars in potential tax obligations on a federal loan and provides tax incentives for car buyers though they are not as extensive as those initially approved by the senate since when do republicans vote against tax cuts asked state representative andy dillon the speaker of the state house whose district overlaps with mr mccotters they are betting the farm because if this works i think people will remember they were not on board joan gebhardt a wayne county commissioner who represents localities in mr mccotters district said her communities need help fast people are hurting but sentiment is clearly mixed on the value of the stimulus plan even though local manufacturers are paring their work forces cutting back shifts for those who stay and reducing the salaries of managers and executives many say it is the worst economic environment they can remember in michigan but the stimulus is not seen as a lifeline for state manufacturers and businesses there is nothing in there for us in michigan in automotive said wallace e smith president of the e e manufacturing company a stamping plant in plymouth that produces seat fasteners and engine mounts we need something immediate as chairman of the republican policy committee mr mccotter is a member of the party leadership but he has broken ranks on some pivotal issues he supported an expansion of a federally financed health insurance program for children and he backs a measure to ease union organizing legislation that is fiercely opposed by most republicans all house republicans from michigan have to be on political alert since two incumbents lost their seats in november mr mccotter saw his own margin of victory shrink noticeably despite being opposed by a weakly financed democratic challenger bill ballenger the editor of inside michigan politics says mr mccotter is the most likely new target for democrats among house members in the state but mr ballenger is skeptical that mr mccotters vote against the stimulus will be much of a political liability particularly if the economy does not improve they may look like heroes a year from now he said democrats evidently believe otherwise given their new assault against mr mccotter and the 11 house members from eight other states including california illinois missouri and pennsylvania besides the automated phone calls the democratic party on tuesday will begin sending e mail and text messages to voters and initiating personal phone calls to lay out the case for the stimulus package mr mccotter said he made no political calculation in deciding how to vote but based his stance on what he thought was the right way to go how can you vote for something in this situation that will do more harm than good he asked yet mr mccotter said he would now try to see that the money is properly spent we will try to do everything we can to squeeze every ounce of help out of what was passed he said we have to make the best of a bad situation

by stephen quakethe snobbish idea that pure science is in some way superior to applied science dates to antiquity when plutarch says of archimedes regarding the business of mechanics and every utilitarian art as ignoble and vulgar he gave his zealous devotion only to those subjects whose elegance and subtlety are untrammeled by the necessities of life the reality appears to have been quite different as archimedes was not just the greatest mathematician of the ancient world but also a clever inventor who drew inspiration from numerous practical problems and based on the historical record few historians today accept plutarch at his word archimedes was one of the first to think deeply about fluid physics and while many people know the famous story about his discovery of the principle of buoyancy he saw the water level rise as he stepped into the bath then ran naked through the streets yelling eureka few know exactly what he was looking for eureka means i found it in ancient greek in fact this discovery is intimately linked with a practical problem he had been asked to solve king hiero wanted to know if he had been cheated by an unscrupulous jeweler who may have given him a crown that was not solid gold archimedes solved this problem by measuring the density of the crown via its buoyancy his practical contributions to fluid physics also include the invention of a screw pump that became widely adopted for irrigation there are numerous other examples of great mathematicians and scientists who wandered between pure and applied problems over the course of their careers carl friedrich gauss moved from number theory to land surveying and geodesy lord kelvin worked on problems as abstract as the nature of entropy while helping discover the second law of thermodynamics and also played a key role in laying the first transatlantic telegraph cable in the 20th century nobel laureate pierre gilles de gennes took inspiration from messy problems in industrial chemistry to develop beautiful theories of fundamental physics another contemporary nobel laureate charles townes noted that not only was his own work inspired by applied physics but also that numerous discoveries in astronomy including the entire field of radioastronomy were serendipitous accidents made by people developing applied technologies these transcendent figures in the history of science flourished by moving back and forth between pure and applied problems in todays more specialized world there are numerous artificial divisions between pure and applied work different departments different professional societies and different journals the stereotyped view is that the applied scientists control the lions share of funding while the basic scientists control the most prestigious journals and prizes the reality is more complicated and lies somewhere in between what remains true is that practical problems can be equally compelling as fundamental ones and often lead in turn to the discovery of new fundamental science in particular there is an intimate connection between the invention of new technology and its application to scientific discovery my own research has certainly benefited from this interplay although i was trained to do pure physics my doctorate is in theoretical physics at a certain point i became interested in developing new measurement technology i began developing microfluidic chips which is the technical name for what i like to call small plumbing eventually my collaborators and i figured out how to make small chips that had thousands of miniature valves on them and i realized that we had invented the biological equivalent of the integrated circuit instead of a silicon chip with wires and transistors we built rubber chips with channels and valves this seemed like a universal tool with which we could automate and expand biology just as the integrated circuit automated and expanded computation and mathematics after a serendipitous meeting with the structural biologist james berger i decided to focus on protein crystallization as an application it seemed like a logical choice and there would be substantial engineering economies of scale that one could achieve what we eventually stumbled on was in fact a rich playground of very basic problems surrounding the physics of crystallization some of which continues to occupy me to this day and as for the biologists well it turned out that small plumbing is indeed a powerful tool for crystallography our chip was commercialized through fluidigm a company i co founded full disclosure i am a consultant and equity holder and commercial versions are used around the world eminent biologists have used them while solving crystal structures for a variety of proteins some of which relate to human health such as vaccine targets from ebola virus and the avian flu and a human integrin protein which play a role in vascular disease such as heart attack and stroke another adventure in small plumbing started with our attempt to use it to create highly multiplexed assays a fairly low key engineering project this ultimately led to the development of a sophisticated commercial dna analysis machine of phenomenal precision and complexity 28 meters of plumbing compressed into a few square centimeters these dna analysis chips are now used by biologists in applications ranging from alaskan salmon fishery management to quality control of seeds for agricultural suppliers they have also found applications in stem cell biology and cancer as a way to measure gene expression in individual cells all of these are completely unexpected applications of the technology so perhaps these stories give a sense of the continuous interplay that can happen between pure and applied research basic problems inspiring the development of new technologies whose application in turn opens the door to new basic science it sometimes happens in a single lab but the baton is also passed from one lab to another and then back again the artificial divisions we academics have created between pure and applied disciplines act as friction for this process and it would behoove us to reach across the divide this is an interesting discussion of the measurement subtleties involved with the story of archimedes and the gold crown read a history of pi by petr beckman for a vigorous defense of archimedes and a unique take on scientific literacy charles townes lays out his own views on the connections between pure and applied research in p n a s 80 pp 7679 7683 1983 some description of the role of physics in

good year is seen for electronics sprague asserts substantial cuts in military spending do not worry industry the electronics industry which sold almost 3 000 000 000 of equipment to the armed forces last year is not worried about substantial cuts in defense spending robert c sprague declared yesterday mr sprague is chairman of the sprague electric company an important electronics producer and the radio electronics television manufacturers association he spoke at a meeting of the new york society of security analysts at the roosevelt hotel the government spent 2 800 000 000 for electronic military equipment in 1953 mr sprague itold the analysts he said this represented 60 per cent of peak military electronics volume during world war ii and added the diversity of electronics devices for both offensive and defensive uses is so much more marked than it was during the last war that there does not appear to he any likelihood of a significant decline in the industrys sales of military equipment there should be an important rise in electronics defense volume in 1954 and it is my firm conviction that this important segment of our business will remain at high levels for the forseeable future despite any reductions which may take place in total defense spending j mr sprague was optimistic about prospects for electronics products that were better known to the public he said sales of black and white television receiv l ers had improved appreciably recently because the public at last had become convinced that color set production would be very lim continued on page 40 column 1 good year is seen for electronics continued from page 35 ited for some time and prices would be high if this trend continues mr sprague declared the inventory situation may have over corrected itself in another month or two he was referring to substantial stocks of black and white receivers in the hands of stores and distributors as the year opened and the widespread public impression that color tv was just around the corner markets opening up for electronics producers aside from entertainment and defense include industrial controls and computers for business and growing automation of factories according to mr sprague no one knows for sure he said what the sales of the electronics industry to the industrial market are but they almost certainly run into hundreds of finil lions although this segment of our business may not equal the dollar importance of radio television and military equipment for a good many years its rate of growth may well be the greatest of all

manila it might have been an innocent enough error the ultraviolet ink in the bar code on millions of ballots for the may elections was not dense enough to be detected by the computers programmed to authenticate them but when officials reported their discovery last month conspiracy theories and predictions of vote fraud ran rampant especially after the commission on elections said it would deactivate this security feature and supplement the computers with manually operated ultraviolet ink readers the kind used to check for counterfeit bank notes the uv ink reader is one the most important security features of the p c o s machines as it ensures the authenticity of the ballots said liza maza a senatorial candidate referring to the precinct count optical scan the computer at the heart of the automated elections the commissions decision to turn off the uv authentication feature ms maza said triples the chances for election fraud to occur in may on may 10 for the first time filipinos will choose their local and national leaders through a totally automated election system the intent is to usher in a new era of politics free of ballot tampering the computerization of elections gives filipinos an opportunity to make a break from the fraud ridden elections of the past said benito o lim a political scientist at ateneo de manila university but such is the history of tainted elections here that many fear computerization may just provide even greater opportunities for disenfranchising voters philippine elections have often been marked by chaos and violence and this round is no exception in november 57 people were killed when a politician tried to stop a rival from filing candidacy papers it was the countrys worst case of election bloodletting but hardly a week goes by without news of a candidate or his supporters being attacked allegations of fraud are common whether in elections for village chieftains or for the presidency among the most notorious cases were the snap elections called by ferdinand marcos the authoritarian president in 1986 when he tried to use what are often referred to here as guns gold and goons against his challenger corazon aquino and the 2004 election which returned the current president gloria macapagal arroyo to power through what the opposition asserted was widespread tampering with election tally sheets historically our problem has always been because elections are done here manually said ramon casiple executive director of the consortium on electoral reforms a nongovernmental group that has been advising the elections commission on the automation project im not saying automation is a panacea but at least it could speed up the election process and minimize human intervention in previous elections paper ballots on which voters wrote in the names of their preferred candidates and then dropped into boxes were recorded and tallied manually on the spot the tally sheets were then carried to town centers and then in the case of national elections to the capital manila where they were counted once again the process took many days sometimes weeks at times tally sheets were padded ballot boxes stolen at gunpoint and election workers harassed and even killed under the new automated system voters will receive ballots with the names of parties and candidates already inscribed they will mark their preferences and feed the ballots into the p c o s machines the final results are expected to be announced within two days but the road to automation has not been smooth questions were raised regarding the ability of the contractor smartmatic tim to set up the system in several tests conducted over the past few months many of the p c o s machines malfunctioned and had problems relaying results via mobile phone networks to the main data center last week smartmatic tim defended the automation project saying that the machines had passed tests and that while there may be problems most of the security features are intact gene gregorio the companys spokesman had earlier allayed fears that the machines would be hacked or the transmission of results compromised pointing out the several security layers in place the center for people empowerment in governance a nongovernmental group that is monitoring the automation process has listed at least 30 vulnerabilities of the p c o s machines among them the fact that the elections commission has not yet made public the source code of the program being used as required by a 2007 law this is to provide independent assurance that the source code has not been altered the commission has said it would hold briefings for computer experts from political parties and independent election monitors the nongovernmental group kontra daya questions whether enough p c o s machines and election inspectors are being provided at polling stations to handle the expected 50 million voters it also cites what it sees as a low level of public awareness wondering if voters will be able to handle the new system one of our greatest fears is that if these issues are not addressed in time for may 10 then we are headed for a trouble filled election day with many disenfranchised voters the group said last month a few days after participating in field tests of the machines the national democratic institute which sent a mission to manila last month to study preparations for automation said that the elections commission had not yet released clear guidelines for conducting a random manual audit to check the automated results which is central to ensuring the integrity of the vote tabulation electronic voting is often employed as a means to ensure the integrity of elections the institute which is based in the united states said in its report however without proper safeguards the use of automation can breed suspicion and be misused political parties said they are worried that the commission seems ill prepared the opposition liberal party the party of the presidential front runner benigno s aquino iii said last month that it was alarmed that the commission had not made public the results of tests of the computers servers printers batteries and power generators that will be used on election day last weekend when overseas filipinos began casting absentee ballots two of the p c o s machines in hong kong failed to work for an hour a problem officials blamed on moisture csar flores a smartmatic official said monday that the company anticipates glitches with up to 400 machines and will have 6 000 spare ones around the country on election day rene sarmiento one of the election commissioners said in an interview last week that contingency plans are still being worked out and that the commission is within its timetable to complete all these preparations by may 10 mr sarmiento pleaded for understanding saying that this is the first fully automated election program in the region were doing our best to make this acceptable to the public he said mr sarmiento said automation is necessary to make elections in the philippines much more orderly and more reflective of the will of the people this will be a total breakaway from the past he said there will be glitches sure but we can do this regardless of the problems automation presents at least we are assured that the old ways of cheating and fraud will not be repeated said mr lim the political scientist but we have to make sure first that the integrity of the whole process is intact that is a crucial first step

for seven years i didnt exist while incarcerated i had no bank statements no bills no credit history in our interconnected world of big data i appeared to be no different than a deceased person after i was released that lack of information about me created a host of problems from difficulty accessing bank accounts to trouble getting a drivers license and renting an apartment in 2010 the iphone was only three years old and many people still didnt see smartphones as the indispensable digital appendages they are today seven years later virtually everything we do causes us to bleed digital information putting us at the mercy of invisible algorithms that threaten to consume our freedom information leakage can seem innocuous in some respects after all why worry when we have nothing to hide we file our taxes we make phone calls we send emails tax records are used to keep us honest we agree to broadcast our location so we can check the weather on our smartphones records of our calls texts and physical movements are filed away alongside our billing information perhaps that data is analyzed more covertly to make sure that were not terrorists but only in the interest of national security were assured our faces and voices are recorded by surveillance cameras and other internet connected sensors some of which we now willingly put inside our homes every time we load a news article or page on a social media site we expose ourselves to tracking code allowing hundreds of unknown entities to monitor our shopping and online browsing habits we agree to cryptic terms of service agreements that obscure the true nature and scope of these transactions according to a 2015 study from the pew research center 91 percent of american adults believe theyve lost control over how their personal information is collected and used just how much theyve lost however is more than they likely suspect the real power of mass data collection lies in the hand tailored algorithms capable of sifting sorting and identifying patterns within the data itself when enough information is collected over time governments and corporations can use or abuse those patterns to predict future human behavior our data establishes a pattern of life from seemingly harmless digital residue like cellphone tower pings credit card transactions and web browsing histories the consequences of our being subjected to constant algorithmic scrutiny are often unclear for instance artificial intelligence silicon valleys catchall term for deepthinking and deep learning algorithms is touted by tech companies as a path to the high tech conveniences of the so called internet of things this includes digital home assistants connected appliances and self driving cars simultaneously algorithms are already analyzing social media habits determining creditworthiness deciding which job candidates get called in for an interview and judging whether criminal defendants should be released on bail other machine learning systems use automated facial analysis to detect and track emotions or claim the ability to predict whether someone will become a criminal based only on their facial features these systems leave no room for humanity yet they define our daily lives when i began rebuilding my life this summer i painfully discovered that they have no time for people who have fallen off the grid such nuance eludes them i came out publicly as transgender and began hormone replacement therapy while in prison when i was released however there was no quantifiable history of me existing as a transwoman credit and background checks automatically assumed i was committing fraud my bank accounts were still under my old name which legally no longer existed for months i had to carry around a large folder containing my old id and a copy of the court order declaring my name change even then human clerks and bank tellers would sometimes see the discrepancy shrug and say the computer says no while denying me access to my accounts such programmatic machine driven thinking has become especially dangerous in the hands of governments and the police in recent years our military law enforcement and intelligence agencies have merged in unexpected ways they harvest more data than they can possibly manage and wade through the quantifiable world side by side in vast usually windowless buildings called fusion centers such powerful new relationships have created a foundation for and have breathed life into a vast police and surveillance state advanced algorithms have made this possible on an unprecedented level relatively minor infractions or microcrimes can now be policed aggressively and with national databases shared among governments and corporations these minor incidents can follow you forever even if the information is incorrect or lacking context at the same time the united states military uses the metadata of countless communications for drone attacks using pings emitted from cellphones to track and eliminate targets in literature and pop culture concepts such as thoughtcrime and precrime have emerged out of dystopian fiction they are used to restrict and punish anyone who is flagged by automated systems as a potential criminal or threat even if a crime has yet to be committed but this science fiction trope is quickly becoming reality predictive policing algorithms are already being used to create automated heat maps of future crimes and like the manual policing that came before them they overwhelmingly target poor and minority neighborhoods the world has become like an eerily banal dystopian novel things look the same on the surface but they are not with no apparent boundaries on how algorithms can use and abuse the data thats being collected about us the potential for it to control our lives is ever growing our drivers licenses our keys our debit and credit cards are all important parts of our lives even our social media accounts could soon become

guernsey dell a manufacturer of chocolate chips and other ice cream flavorings will never rival general motors saturn project in size nevertheless when chicago officials learned that the family owned company might move to georgia or new mexico because it needed a larger facility they leaped into action the city provided industrial revenue bonds a 190 000 grant to reduce land costs a 1 5 million low interest loan and a host of consultants to advise the company on the best way to finance its expansion ultimately guernsey dell moved its 140 employees to an 8 5 acre site where chicago s slaughterhouses once stood the last thing new mexico and some other states wanted to hear was that we had concluded that we re better off staying in chicago said barry horne the company president it is no longer hog butcher to the world but the city of broad shoulders still has 6 200 manufacturers and officials are working hard to make them feel good about staying that is far more sensible the officials say than chasing after giants like saturn which after being wooed by 40 states chose to put its thousands of jobs in tennessee governors and mayors like nothing more than to cut a ribbon at a new plant said robert mier chicago s commissioner of economic development but most professionals in the field recognize that you can get greater payoffs from retention than attraction indeed more and more rust belt cities are striving to preserve and nurture the industry they have an increasing number of economic development experts are questioning the tens of millions of dollars cities and states spend in efforts to attract big new plants i get the sense that many places don t get much of a payoff compared with the amount of incentive money that they ve put up to attract these large plants said james e peterson an economic development expert at northwestern university in recent years recessions a strong dollar and low wage competition abroad have severely damaged manufacturing across the nation in the chicago area united states steel has closed most of its huge south works and schwinn has shuttered a bicycle plant general motors is to shut a plant in willow springs a chicago suburb elsewhere in the middle west the giant auto maker is to close 10 plants affecting a total of 29 000 workers throughout the industry the united auto workers union estimates automation will cost 120 000 jobs in the next five years some critics citing such figures say factory employment is shrinking inexorably and chicago should worry more about increasing the number of service sector jobs mr mier responds that keeping factory jobs is important not only because wages are high but also because manufactured products are sold elsewhere and bring money into a city many service industries on the other hand involve money that is simply handed around among residents of one area the death of manufacturing is a myth we re running against said mr mier if we write off our manufacturing that means we may lose it faster we re working to flatten the decline the same thing is being said throughout the middle west when alumax was thinking of moving its aluminum fabrication plant from st louis to iowa st louis came up with a package of incentives to keep it these included a 25 year tax abatement scheme a 2 million low interest loan and an 8 million industrial revenue bond i ve been involved in this field for 25 years said robert renard of the st louis office of business development for a long time i was going after the glamour deals but you might land just 1 in 100 meanwhile you re turning your back on the local guy who has been paying the taxes and providing the jobs for maybe 30 or 50 years we ve concluded you can make a lot more progress by concentrating on local business and helping them expand this help often means taking an individualized approach to keep its 200 000 metal fabricating jobs most of them on the south side chicago is working to improve trucking facilities there recognizing that its huge merchandise mart attracts apparel buyers from department stores around the nation chicago officials are trying to strengthen the ties between local apparel makers and the fashion industry the wisdom nowadays is that the principal area of job creation is in new and small businesses said lawrence howe executive director of the civic committee of the commercial club of chicago a business organization working with the city to bolster the economy acting on that idea st paul has a city owned industrial incubator building in which companies that are getting off the ground enjoy low rents and benefit from subsidized job training st paul officials hope this help will enable small companies to expand faster and move to new larger quarters instead of spending a lot of time and effort in the very competitive business of trying to lure saturns to st paul said james bellus st paul s director of economic development we think it s better to put our limited resources into working with home grown companies like 3m that international giant started above a grocery store 84 years ago

navarrevisca spain old vineyards dot the landscape surrounding this village about an hour west of madrid but to find the tiny astounding rumbo al norte vineyard where 70 year old garnacha vines grow on granite and sandstone slopes threaded with quartz and strewn with gigantic boulders you not only have to know someone you have to earn his trust for as long as anybody can remember old vineyards like this one in the foothills of the sierra de gredos mountains have been cherished by a dedicated few who nurtured the vines through hot summers and cold winters the work was exhausting especially in the years before automation and automobiles simply getting to the vineyards which can approach 4 000 feet above sea level was an arduous project even today they are tended almost entirely by hand the reward for decades the garnacha as grenache is known in spanish went to the local cooperative which made bulk wines that ended up in anonymous blends many growers lost money on their vines but their attachment to the land was deep transcending economics beyond the elderly caretakers whose children were seldom interested in carrying on their stewardship not many valued these old vineyards twenty years ago the few commercial wineries in the area were planting cabernet sauvignon and merlot on the flatlands in an effort to appeal to international markets many of the old vineyards have been abandoned over the decades you can sometimes see traces of them their ancient stone terraces fading back into the hillsides only in the last decade has it become apparent that the area could offer agricultural riches to those willing to seek them out nobody has searched harder for these old vineyards than fernando garca and daniel gmez jimnez landi two 40 ish men who make fresh precise delicate wines under the curious label comando g and nobody has worked harder to demonstrate that the grapes from these vineyards could make world class wines over the last 10 years mr garca and mr landi have tracked down vineyards that were only legends whispered about in taverns or in the fields they befriended farmers and earned their trust and respect we have a big big treasure here mr landi said the big heroes are those who worked and maintained these vineyards even as they lost money selling to the co ops mr landi who goes by dani said the vineyard prospecting has required a great deal of research talking to old guys in bars he said i found when you drink beer you find good vineyards today along with comando g a handful of producers working in the sierra de gredos is showing how distinctive the wines can be from an area that was ignored for so long among them are bernabeleva which makes superb reds and whites of garnacha and albillo real daniel ramos whose wines are quite good though they still seem to be grasping for an identity and rubor viticultores which makes natural wines that can be both fascinating and challenging but the bottles with the most finesse and nuance and which have drawn the most interest are from comando g whose wines are now among the most compelling in spain the entry level red la bruja de rozas is lovely and floral with light chalky mineral flavors rozas 1er cru is a step up not as effusive or ample as la bruja and a little more chiseled most striking are a trio of wines made from old vine garnacha grown in granite at high altitudes all striking similar chords yet discernibly different las umbras from a vineyard of sandy granite and clay tastes like flowers citrus and minerals tumba del rey moro from a vineyard of almost pure granite with ancient vines interspersed with trees is more like concentrated rose petals yet distinctly salty rumbo al norte is dry chalky and almost austere the texture of this vineyard is the texture of the wine mr garca said pointing to fine grains of quartz as we wandered among the boulders in rumbo al norte collectively they are among the most striking grenache based wines i have had the label comando g comes from a spanish 1980s cartoon based on science ninja team gatchaman a japanese anime series from the 70s but just as important the g could stand for gredos the region where they prospected for vineyards and it could stand for garnacha ten years ago when comando g was getting started most of the garnacha wines in spain were jammy concentrated oaky and alcoholic the comando g team looked for inspiration instead from france where they found wines in a different style like the legendary chteauneuf du papes of chteau rayas made entirely of grenache and known for their subtle intricate grace and the exquisite ceps centenaires la mm cuve from domaine gramenon a producer in the ctes du rhne mr garca and mr landi took many trips to burgundy to the rhne and the loire and eventually to roussillon in the south and to sicily and the barolo region of italy in spain we didnt have any references said mr garca who goes by fer we learned about terroir and minerality in france and italy but not in spain the need to look elsewhere for inspiration was partly a legacy of the long franco dictatorship which effectively closed off spanish winemakers from the rest of the wine world and from their own heritage emerging from the dictatorship in the 1980s and 90s mr garca said and disconnected from their own spanish wine traditions they tried to duplicate internationally popular wine styles aiming for dark colors power and impact rather than freshness or expression of place only in recent years mr garca said have many spanish winemakers felt freer to explore their own tastes and muses were not trying to copy the style of burgundy but to follow the philosophy mr landi said every village here is completely different we want to express the style of each village mr landi grew up in the region his family owned vineyards and was one of the first in the area to bottle its own wine with the encouragement of the european union his family planted international varieties rather than the traditional grapes but mr landi found that garnacha grown at high altitude was much more to his taste he eventually left the family business and started his own label daniel gmez jimnez landi making wines of a similar ilk to the comando gs but from different sites in madrid mr landi met mr garcia who was studying agricultural engineering and working at one of the citys best wine shops together with a third partner marc isart who eventually dropped out they started comando g in 2008 at first it was a hobby mr landi had his family label while mr garca worked for telmo rodriguez one of spains more dynamic wine entrepreneurs who himself was one of the early explorers of the potential of the sierra de gredos region mr garca had also started another label bodega maraones which like mr landis label also makes excellent wines from the region up until 2012 or 13 we both had day jobs and worked weekends and holidays on comando g mr garca said now comando g is the day job in their search for old vineyards they are looking for three qualities granite soils garnacha and altitude the soils provide strength and freshness in the wines mr landi said garnacha which mr landi calls the pinot noir of the south gives the winemakers the ability to produce fresh elegant wines altitudes of at least 2 500 feet and preferably 3 000 to 4 000 allow a longer ripening cycle and wines with less alcohol and more balance the men are especially interested in vineyards facing east and north which receive less direct heat especially important in the era of climate change the region encompasses three different valleys with three different climates from mediterranean in the southern titar and alberche valleys to continental in the northern alto alberche the divergence is reflected in the landscape where lavender and fig and olive trees in the southern part give way to oak chestnuts and almonds in the north while there is great diversity in the land the appellation system has not kept up the official appellation vios de madrid encompasses three provinces with widely differing climate and geology so comando g prefers the unofficial sierra de gredos the more specific region with bottles identified by village as well when appropriate they farm biodynamically but each vineyard mr garca said required slightly different techniques derived often by observing how the older people worked the land all the garnachas are fermented with their stems in the ancient fashion the single vineyard wines in big oak vats the others in a mixture of oak and concrete the aim always is to preserve freshness with grenache you dont need structure you need acidity mr garca said comando g also makes a tiny amount of a lovely white wine from garnacha gris and garnacha blanc el tamboril which smells like lemons rocks and flowers in a sort of full circle the comando g partners are now consulting with the local cooperative granito del cadalso which from a peak of almost entirely bulk wine production in the 1980s had found itself in serious difficulty as people left agriculture for factory or construction work since 2015 the aim has been to produce smaller quantities of better quality wine in bottles rather than bulk wine the 2017 was fresh fruity direct and easy to drink a good value for about 15 the comando g wines range from about 25 to 100 or more for the single vineyard wines for comando g it has been a remarkable decade ten years is not so long in the wine business mr garca said but 10 years ago there was practically nothing here follow nyt food on
