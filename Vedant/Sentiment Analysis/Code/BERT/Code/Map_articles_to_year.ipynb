shipbuilding industry the harmstorf workers are the lucky ones because many of them still have jobs seventy miles to the south in the port of hamburg 3 500 workers at the much bigger howaldtswerke will soon be laid off the victims of a worldwide collapse of the shipbuilding industry like many other small shipyards across northern europe harmstorf has weathered the industry s storm relatively well until now their moderate size and flexibility kept fixed costs down and the yards kept humming by providing specialized vessels such as chemical tankers sophisticated oceanographic research ships or the roll on roll off container carriers favored by developing countries with a dearth of good harbors now however even the smaller yards are feeling the impact orders for new ships dwindle and the number of idle vessels grows the result of the continuing worldwide recession and the shrinkage of international trade few orders for big shipsthe world s big shipyards are under even more severe pressure they face widespread shutdowns and layoffs resulting from high overhead a lack of orders for the big vessels they build and fierce competition from low cost competitors in japan and south korea in addition the success of the small yards has hurt the big shipbuilders to meet the small yards competition they have been forced to bid below cost thus running up losses that have caused cash shortages at some yards the downturn is going to exact a heavy toll said christoph von der decken the board member of the dresdner bank in hamburg responsible for the shipping industry late in march howaldtswerke deutsche werft west germany s secondbiggest shipbuilder announced that it would close part of its big hamburg yards and lay off 3 500 of 12 000 shipyard workers earlier the city of bremen a shipbuilding center and several german banks put up matching 16 million loans to save bremer vulkan the nation s no 1 builder after a greek shipping company pushed vulkan to the brink of bankruptcy by canceling 40 million worth of orders worrisome unemploymentalong the clyde in scotland scott lithgow britain s biggest shipbuilder has said it may have to let 2 000 of its 5 000 workers go as its order backlog shrinks this summer with european unemployment at record levels the fate of the big yards and their workers worries political leaders as well as industry officials in west germany europe s leading shipbuilding nation two thirds of the 26 500 shipyard workers are employed by the five biggest yards people who follow the industry say the big shipyards fell victim to their own ambitions by investing heavily in the 1960 s and 1970 s in the huge automated wharves they thought they needed to overcome the japanese and south korean yards that had invaded the market for supertankers they re building the same ships we are in yards meant for vessels three times the size said heinrich kerlen harmstorf s managing director but with all that overhead their fixed costs are double ours and harmstorf s competitive position is likely to improve it has spent 41 million in the last two years to increase automation use labor more efficiently and smooth the flow of materials at its three german shipyards false hopes based on coaleven after skyrocketing oil prices curtailed oil shipments the prospect of a growing trade in cheap coal to replace costly oil buoyed the hopes of shipbuilding officials as the recession reduced the demand for oil however and a boom in coal did not materialize bulk cargo shipments declined so did the need for new ships the institute for the economy of shipping in bremen said in a recent survey that the number of idle transport ships over 300 tons swelled worldwide in march to 1 460 or 6 4 percent more than in january facing a collapse of demand the industry began closing yards and laying off workers at a dramatic pace in recent years according to a report released in march by the common market annual shipbuilding capacity in its 10 member nations dropped to 3 5 million tons in 1981 from 5 million tons 10 years earlier in west germany the number of shipyard workers plummeted to 16 500 from 47 000 in 1975 in britain the number dropped to 25 300 from 54 500 at the same time european governments pumped billions of dollars of aid into the industry to expand the shipyards capacity to produce the smaller specialized vessels that brought success to smaller companies like harmstorf financing guidelines setmore recently with many shipyard customers particularly in the developing countries short on cash financing has become the key to sales financing guidelines for the shipbuilding industry as set within the organization for economic cooperation and development limit loans to 80 percent of the total purchase cost and prescribe a maximum maturity of eight to 12 years at a minimum interest rate of 8 percent but most european shipbuilding nations skirt these guidelines by linking financing to foreign aid agreements with developing countries that buy ships or by offering aid programs that take up the slack between the o e c d standards and the terms a shipyard can afford to offer nevertheless industry analysts expect little respite before a general economic recovery spurs trade and lifts the demand for new ships common market economists in brussels expect an industry recovery in 1985 or 1986 not everyone is optimistic however harmstorf s mr kerlen fingering a common market chart showing production flat until 1984 and then surging up to the 1977 level by 1990 mused i won t really believe it until i see it

expecting to buy back an equal number of shares later at a lower price and thereby make a profit two viewsmany analysts and traders have in the past considered short sales to be bearish short sellers take a lot of risk since they lose money when stocks go up thus a rise in short interest presumably represents a strong belief that the market will turn down but others reason that a rise in short interest could presage a stronger stock market they contend that since a short seller must eventually buy back the shares that have been sold short a large short interest position can exert a stabilizing or even upward influence on stock prices predictability questionedin general the value of short interest as a predictive indicator of market bullishness or bearishness has been called into question in recent years that is primarily because stock is sold short by arbitragers involved in many special situations some interpretations of recent internal revenue service rulings have also led

      "['the metro north rail strike in which 90 000 commuters have been forced to find other means of transportation centers on one issue management s insistence that it determine crew sizes and what the union sees as its need for strong contract language to protect its members jobs but a number of other issues exist that seem to lessen the possibilities for a quick settlement no talks are scheduled by arvid anderson the chairman of new york city s office of collective bargaining and mr anderson sees no reason before the weekend or early next week to ask bargainers to return for talks yesterday four connecticut public officials called for new efforts to end the strike but there still seemed to be little pressure from commuters or officials to help force an end to the strike now in its fourth day finding other transportationcommuters are finding other transportation and richard ravitch the chairman of the metropolitan transportation authority which is metro north s parent organization displays letters from commuters urging him to remain strong in his effort to bring what he sees as efficiencies to the line willaim a beebe the united transportation union s general chairman for the new haven line says a long strike is likely how we are going to end this i don t know he says generally the way out of such an impasse involves buying out workers jobs and providing management guarantees that jobs will be eliminated through attrition a federal board said in december that the railroad s management should set crew sizes mr anderson who headed that board says both sides know that reductions should be made through attrition efficient system is goala key problem mr beebe says is that mr ravitch is adamant that he will not compromise in his demand that the management set crew sizes such adamancy often characterizes bargainers statements but mr ravitch insists he will not change his position he says that he must run an efficient system and that to achieve this the management must determine crew sizes the management says it must insure its right to establish crew sizes on metro north composed of the hudson harlem and new haven lines because it may find efficiencies that can be made including the use of further automation or other advanced railroad technologies the railroad cannot be hindered by artificial restrictions lewis b kaden the m t a counsel says almost insurmountable to mr beebe of the rail union mr ravitch s public statements mean that mr ravitch s feet are in concrete and that his bargaining position is thus extremely limited since he s making his positions known in the press it s almost an insurmountable problem to negotiate because his credibility will come into question if he has to compromise in any way mr beebe says mr beebe asserts that we are not trying to keep people who are not needed but he says the union needs protection on crew sizes to preserve the jobs necessary to run the railroad in an efficient safe manner contracts make for better labor management relations he contends because they prevent uncertainty and arbitrary management actions he proposes that crew sizes not only be set by contract but also be kept in line with those on other railroads including amtrak almost all american railroads he says establish crew sizes through collective bargaining the metro north management believes that if it sets crew sizes amtrak will make similar demands job reduction proposedwhen talks broke off at 2 35 a m on monday the management proposed a reduction of 70 jobs from 540 full time positions with the union saying that it stood to lose 150 or more jobs under the management plan the management has offered 5 000 buyouts to 70 people eligible to retire this year and it has proposed placing the crew size issue before binding arbitration mr beebe insists that the management put in writing the job cuts it wants to make because he believes that the m t a ultimately will seek to make more reductions no question seems to exist that if additional cuts can be made the management will make them no restrictions on l i r r another factor in the dispute is that the long island rail road has no crew restrictions mr ravitch and other managers of the metropolitan transportation authority fear that if restrictions are placed in effect on the metro north lines the long island rail union will demand similar restrictions mr kaden the authority s counsel said management bargainers also say the talks are complicated because it must deal in metro north bargaining not only with 17 unions but also in the case of the united transportation union with three different union leaders mr beebe richard frear the union s general chairman on the hudson and harlem lines and edward yule jr an international representative of the union and the general chairman of the u t u for the long island rail road the metro north management maintains that only mr beebe wanted a strike and that in bargaining with the 16 other unions it made no manning agreements mr beebe himself faces difficulties the management contends he insists that he is in no danger of losing his job but some management negotiators believe that if he accepts a contract that substantially reduces the number of jobs on the railroad he could be voted from office organizing bid by teamstersthe situation is perhaps further complicated by the fact that the international brotherhood of teamsters is attempting to organize metro north workers and mr beebe may fear that a contract viewed as poor by his members may strengthen the teamsters position mr beebe contends that the teamsters effort is not important he says mr ravitch wants to appear to the public as being strong in forcing restrictions on labor mr ravitch is trying to be a union buster mr beebe says mr kaden the m t a counsel rejects this when you look at the people on the management side ravitch scannell usery me that s not a very antilabor group mr kaden says he was referring in addition to mr ravitch and himself daniel t scannell first vice chairman of the authority and w j usery jr a former united states secretary of labor and a

      "['the price of health examining the medical system third of five articles by lawrence k altmanat a time when the cost of medical care is soaring and doctors are being urged to practice more cost effective medicine many people are asking these basic questions how good is american medical care in relation to its cost and what would have to be sacrificed in terms of quality to reduce that cost the technological sophistication of american medicine is regarded as unsurpassed the expertise of this nation s doctors in applying it has helped extend the lives of millions of people and has improved the quality of life for millions more and the gains have occurred concurrently with a huge american investment in health from 1940 to 1980 the share of the gross national product devoted to health care rose to 9 4 percent from 4 percent in the same period the life expectancy for an american rose to 73 6 years from 62 9 from 1960 to 1980 maternal mortality dropped to 6 9 from 37 1 deaths per 100 000 live births and infant mortality fell to 12 5 from 26 per 1 000 live births and the numbers of deaths from 10 of the 15 leading causes have fallen since 1968 targets of criticismthe quality of the care that has resulted in those advances involves countless intangibles from bedside manner to surgical skill then too there is the ability to make the critical judgments that are the essential part of everyday medicine and while the expense of modern medicine includes crucial human factors in training and staffing critics have frequently focused on costly high technology targets such as these intensive care units to treat infants born prematurely and older patients who are recovering from accidents surgery heart attacks and many other conditions dialysis treatments with artificial kidneys and kidney transplant operations to keep alive tens of thousands of people who would otherwise die from renal disease synthesis of many new drugs to treat and even prevent death from the complications of heart disease hypertension infections and many other common conditions advances in the laboratory tests that physicians rely upon in diagnosing and managing the care of thousands of common and rare disorders cat scanners computerized x ray machines that have revolutionized the care of patients with neurological disorders by improving the accuracy of diagnosis and sparing patients painful procedures the incorporation of many new approaches some of them mechanical and others procedural such as new types of surgery without adequate pilot and clinical studies with the result of overpayment for the amount of benefit received according to interviews and a review of articles in medical journals many leaders in government medicine and other fields are discussing not only whether americans are paying too much for such care but also whether their money if spent on other programs would be more profitable for society in some instances clearly inefficiency can be pared with no major loss in quality of care in other instances painful philosophical questions are raised in linking quality to cost treatment of babies an issuefor example in the case of neonatal intensive care units premature and critically ill babies receive continuous care with respirators and other sophisticated technologies as well as highly specialized physicians and nurses six percent of all live births in this country require such care at an estimated cost of 1 5 billion a year the figure is about the same for coronary bypass surgery and the treatment of the otherwise terminal stages of chronic kidney disease both of which are the focus of controversies over costs it is cost effective to treat babies weighing 1 500 grams which is about 3 3 pounds or more but not those weighing 1 000 grams which is about 2 2 pounds or less according to a federal study conducted at the university of california at san francisco the difference the researchers said reflects the fact that the lifetime costs of caring for the severely handicapped infants who survive outweighs in economic terms the benefits to the thousands of babies who would have died without neonatal intensive care and who survived to lead normal lives withholding care from all newborns weighing 1 000 grams or less to avert the exceptional costs of the severely abnormal survivors would take the lives of many potentially normal babies said dr peter budetti and his colleagues who did the study for the federal office of technology assessment clearly a policy decision to withhold care from such low birthweight infants should not be based solely on cost effectiveness another therapy involving relatively few people at extraordinarily high expense is that for end stage kidney disease this treatment which is saving the lives of everyone who receives it has cost much more than estimated when the federal program to provide such care was introduced in june 1973 the treatments kidney dialysis and kidney transplant operations will cost an estimated 1 056 billion in 1982 for the 59 125 patients enrolled according to the federal health care financing administration pick up 1st add qualitygraf beginning treating more patients x x x first and last add qualitytreating more patients with the artificial kidney at home instead of at hospitals and other centers would be a preferable form of treatment for many patients and would reduce the costs of treatment according to dr christopher r blagg of the northwest kidney center in seattle he said that the costs of dialysis in washington were only about 75 percent of the national average for all dialysis care because many more patients received home dialysis in washington than in the country as a whole the national rate of home dialysis is 17 percent as against more than 50 percent in washington audits published in the federal register last month said the the average cost for home dialysis was 97 per treatment as against 108 in out patient facilities and 135 in hospitals the usual number of treatments is three per week but dialysis is mired in controversy between those who argue for the convenience and cost savings of home treatment and those who argue that using centers is safer and needed for the many patients who cannot be treated at home because of their age and other medical problems some critics charge that a major impediment to expanding home treatment is the profit motive intensive care united assailedintensive care units or i c u s where adults are treated for heart attacks lung disease and other serious conditions have also come under criticism dr william a knaus who heads the intensive care unit at george washington university hospital in washington where president reagan was treated after he was shot a year ago contended that doctors could practice better medicine by using i c u s less at a new york city hospital a heart attack patient pays 560 a day to stay in a coronary care unit the cost of such care depends on several variables such as the seriousness of the patient s condition the type of ailment and the cost of living in the area of where the care is being delivered one of dr knaus s suggestions was that physicians should be more selective in admitting terminally ill patients for whom the life support capabilities of an i c u are useless this is a difficult and controversial problem he said but one that society must face soon because of the unlimited economic and emotional costs such aggressive but futile treatment creates as for drugs the development of antibiotics has lessened the public health threats of tuberculosis pneumonia and scores of other infectious diseases use of anti hypertensive drugs has begun to reduce drastically the rates of death and severe complications from high blood pressure some diseases under controldeath statistics fail to reflect the control if not eradication of many other diseases that are crippling and serious but usually not fatal no longer do americans fear polio because immunizations prevent it but at the same time there is much room for improvement studies published in medical journals have shown that the prescribing habits of some physicians are sloppy even dangerous in such cases patients are not just paying too much they are being charged for improper treatment the cost to the nation is in the millions of dollars automated technology has made it possible simultaneously and accurately to do many laboratory tests on a single blood specimen at reduced cost yet this too has raised costs in some instances although automation makes it easier for doctors to order many more tests doctors sometimes have to repeat the tests because the first results gave spuriously abnormal values for example a doctor who was specifically testing the blood sugar level might also get a result that showed an unusually high level of calcium which often shows a false positive the doctor then would have to do further tests to determine its significance at least three studies suggest that doctors ignore many normal and abnormal laboratory test results this implies that the laboratory determinations were not needed in the first place lois p myers and dr steven a schroeder of the university of california at san francisco said in the milbank memorial fund quarterly the significance is heightened by the fact that laboratory tests and xray services now account for up to 25 percent of total bills at some hospitals warning on problem s intricacybut last week a study by dr schroeder s team cautioned that the problems of technology in medical practice were more intricate than previously recognized and that options on policies to control the rising cost of medical care should recognize that the use of technology differs according to diagnosis and clinical specialty there are many reasons for ordering laboratory tests one is the fear of malpractice suits perhaps a more fundamental factor is that medical schools encourage wide use of tests medical school professors have been more inclined to ask younger doctors why didn t you order these tests than why did you but there are signs of change some medical schools are teaching students the concepts of cost effective practice however as the editors of the lancet one of the world s most respected medical journals published in london noted the costeffectiveness approach has hardly penetrated medical education and practice focus on overuse of technologywhile most people agree that technology has been a potent positive force in medicine even reducing costs in some instances as it diminishes hospitalization the criticism focuses on overuse some say the costly cat scan is used when it might not be needed at one new york city hospital it costs from 1 million to 1 5 million to buy and install the machine and the cost of a scan is 300 to 350 depending on the part of the body involved the issue extends to conventional x rays electrocardiograms and laboratory tests that may be repeated daily is more better modern hospitals face many incentives to use technology but few reasons to constrain it dr charles a sanders the former director of the massachusetts general hospital has said as an example of the overwhelming changes and bewildering array of new services and facilties from 1965 to 1975 the boston hospital created a total of 10 intensive care units and hired 1 862 additional employees although the total number of patient days per year changed very little dr george himler a former president of the medical society of the state of new york has said that health professions have been reluctant to raise the question of limits on benefits and expenditures equating such limits with a deteroriation in the quality of health care it is not clear to what extent improved health statistics the decline in death rates for instance are directly related to the increased expenditures and growing technology rather than to improved socioeconomic environmental and other factors the factor of abuse of the systembut much more is involved in the care of patients than can show up in health statistics among a physician s primary obligations are relieving pain and anxiety and easing the process of dying they take time and skill to some extent the high cost of medical care can be attributed to abuses of the system especially in government programs but such abuses appear to make a minimal contribution to the overall costs according to dr robert blendon of the robert wood johnson foundation in princeton n j and thomas w moloney of the commonwealth fund in new york they said medicaid is a far better and more indispensable program than commonly realized it serves a broad cross section of the american people it probably does improve health and its program costs per recipient are no higher than the per person costs of care for all americans of similar age before medicaid people with low income saw physicians far less often than did middle class people but by the mid 1970 s this inequity had been erased even if every claim of fraud abuse and overuse proved true they said the net cost of any such failings is not enough to raise the per person cost of the program above the per person cost of medical care for comparable non recipient americans situation in other countriesno western nation seems to have solved the problem of controlling rising costs without rationing services largely because it costs more not less money to introduce new knowledge and technology paradoxically the united states which began spending substantial amounts of taxpayers money for health care plans much later than such western european countries as britain and sweden which have had well publicized national health insurance plans seems to be ahead of them in terms of confronting the problems of quality and cost of care a limited number of studies have been conducted in other countries and they have shown variations in the way doctors practice medicine for example the use of laboratory testing services the number of operations performed and the use of antibiotics what they show is not encouraging to those who want to cut costs by limiting profits to doctors the studies seem to show less connection than expected between the amount of services offered and the method of payment room for improvement notedto some costly technology is being used as a scapegoat and to others concern about money may be a red herring there is still they say much room for improvement in medical care despite the gains of recent years in the last 65 years said dr robert h brook of the university of california at los angeles and the rand corporation about 500 research studies have been published assessing the level of quality of care delivered and virtually all these studies have detected basic problems in the level of quality delivered but beyond those failings many problems involved in the quality of care are socioeconomic so often people equate medical care with professional care said dr daniel d federman a dean of harvard medical school they reflect distance population clustering personal habits and

revived by mind boggling leaps in computer science gradually but inexorably the police department a vast bureacracy where pc still means the police commissioner not a piece of high tech equipment is catching up with the electronic age but it still has some distance to go especially on the precinct level since the mid 1960 s the new york city police department has been using the most sophisticated 911 system in the nation a computer based system that uses a modified software program originally developed to help the airline industry keep track of reservations it has been continously upgraded over the years in addition the department uses big computers in a centralized system for booking suspects maintaining files on its own personnel issuing checks and conducting long term crime analysis it also routinely collects information on stolen cars and other property not to mention fingerprints by plugging into the computers of the federal bureau of investigation and of state police agencies nationwide some radio cars have laptop computers that can check license plates and on election day the department even uses its computers to help transmit election returns for the city but some police and civilian employees at police headquarters complain privately that the department s long range computer development program seems disorganized others note that routine requests for information can sometimes take days a problem that some officials blame partly on built in security measures which put data out of reach of many police department employees on the precinct level the use of computers especially for crime analysis has been especially limited the most recent widespread application has been the introduction of computerized roll calls at about 40 precincts officials say the 32 000 computer system in the 67th precinct which officially went on line to one of the five big computers in police headquarters in january is the only one of its kind among the city s 75 precincts only one other precinct the 13th in the gramercy park section of manhattan has anything resembling it and that system officials say has lately been beset by training and software problems both are part of an experiment that began in january to test the feasibility and usefulness of a crime analysis system in each station house decisions remain it s a prototype said andrew chiasera who as director of the department s management information systems division has played a key role in devising ways to expand the use of computers at the precinct level we wanted to see how it would work in one of the busier precincts and so far it s worked very well but mr chiasera said that the department s data processing policy review board still had to make many decisions on cost and equipment before it ordered

mini computers in each precinct a step he said would be financed through a 1 7 million office automation effort so far mr chiasera said the city has given the police department virtually everything it had ever requested for computer development we re conducting a survey from around the country of 50 other police departments and i don t get the sense that anybody is really that far ahead of us in computer technology said philip g mcguire a civilian who heads the department s crime analysis section a few smaller departments have started to put in sophisticated systems but they re able to move faster because in many cases they don t need to spend millions of dollars on computers but thousands overcoming fiscal crisisjack m meth the computer center director of john jay college of criminal justice said in terms of computing they have very good procedures for doing crime analysis and an excellent telecommunications system mr mcguire and others blame the fiscal crisis of the mid 1970 s for derailing the department s best laid plans adding that the speed with which new computer technologies developed in the 1980 s made the catch up process more difficult another factor officials say has been difficulty attracting high priced talent at civil service salaries at the 67th precinct we get approximately 20 000 complaint reports per year said police officer william a aronston the six seven s station manager and resident computer expert noting that the crime level placed the precinct among the city s five busiest that s a lot of digging to do when we need to find something with the computerized system we just punch it up plucking the pin mapsat less fortunate precincts monthly crime reports with detailed breakdowns must be compiled by hand a process that can take days pin maps
