BERT_DTM.7z, BERT.7z - These two files Inside the Model Files folder contains everything related ot the final models generated. The DTM Model does not have the embeddings, so cannot generate some graphs.

Results - This folder contains all the results.

BERTopic.ipynb - Contains the code to generate graphs for BERTopic model decade wise.

BERTDTM_FINAL.ipynb - Contains the code to generate graphs for BERTopic Dynamic Topic Modeling.

Pakages.txt - Contains all the packages used in the enviornment with versions as well so anyone can replicate the code.
