UNIONS DEMANDING NEW JOB PROGRAMS
WASHINGTON, Dec. 12 UPI)—A group of unions urged new Federal programs today to spur the lagging economy by providing jobs for workers displaced b.y machines.
In separate reports they said automation was permitting industries to produce more with fewer workers. They said the business slowdown had further increased machine-caused layoffs.	•	‘
The reports covering unemployment in the steel, electrical, automobile, coal and other industries were prepared by the unions at the request of Representative Elmer J. Holland.
The Pennsylvania Democrat planned to use the reports at a meeting with other Democratic members of the House Education and Labor Committee. He said the reports had justified his proposal for a subcommittee to determine what Federal measures were needed to help the unemployed train themselves for new jobs.
In his report on steel unemployment, David J. McDonald, head of the United Steelworkers, of America, included Federal aid for school construction among the measures he considered necessary to promote economic growth and counteract lay-offs.
