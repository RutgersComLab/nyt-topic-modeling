THE MENACE OF MICROELECTRONICS,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast); New York, N.Y.",1980,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/menace-microelectronics/docview/423998836/se-2?accountid=14586,"T HE development of microelectronics is coming to fruition at a time of sluggish economic growth and record postwar levels of unemployment in many Western industrial countries. This gloomy economic environment makes the technology at once promising and threatening.
On the one hand, it offers the prospect of enhanced productivity and the chance to revitalize some economic activities. But it also threatens to aggravate unemployment in some industries and to reinforce the structural divisions that have been growing in the industrial countries.
Microelectronics is the technology that began with the transistor and came of age with the integrated circuit, the very small semiconductor devices now used in everything from digital watches to computers to automation machinery on the factory floor. In many respects, the development and application of microelectronics brings into focus the issues that surround the so-called reindustrialization policies being pursued by several Western governments.
At the heart of those policies is an attempt to increase productivity by stimulating high-technology industries that offer prospects for rapid growth and long-term economic success.
Since the electronics industry is one of the leading growth areas in an otherwise flaccid global economy, it has naturally come to the fore in discussions of reindustrialization. The hope is that microelectronics will be able to overcome some of the constraints on productivity growth that have emerged in virtually every country.
In part, the attention being lavished on microelectronics - and the government funds being poured into its development - are a response to international economic pressures. In an interdependent world economy, governments have little choice but to insure that their high-technology industries are in good health.
If the implications are sobering for the advanced industrial countries, they are even more alarming for countries that barely have one foot on the industrial ladder. The microelectronic revolution adds a new factor to international competition that could make it more and more difficult for poor countries to close the technological gap.
There are two dimensions to the international race. The first is the competition to stay in the vanguard of the technology of constructing integrated circuits. In this race, the United States holds a commanding position; Japan is rapidly moving to the fore in some areas, but European countries lag.
The benefits of keeping abreast of the technology are in one sense obvious -there is a $10 billion global market in microelectronic devices. But there are also hidden advantages in the crossfertilization between designers and users of microelectronics.
More important, however, is the competition to use microelectronics in goods and industrial processes, for this is where the chief economic benefits lie. The experience of the American automobile industry in failing to adopt front-wheel drive and other energysaving technologies provides a painful reminder of how severe the economic penalties of technological backwardness can be.
These pressures, both political and commercial, make it inevitable that microelectronics will be developed and applied as swiftly as possible.
But the efforts to push the technology have so far not been matched by policies to deal with its potential negative side effects. The nostalgic hope seems to be that microelectronics, along with other high-technology industries, will lead the way back to the golden days of the postwar era, when the world economy expanded at a rate that provided high demand that in turn created millions of new jobs. Such a development is at best unlikely.
Virtually every recent study of world economic prospects has concluded that the global economy faces a period of slow and uncertain growth, given rising energy costs, concern over environmental degradation, the use of restrictive monetarist policies to dampen inflation and growing protectionism.
T HE development and application of microelectronics and other technologies will help to stimulate growth in some areas, but it will do little to remove the underlying causes of sluggish economic growth.
The transition thus requires policies both to deal with technological unemployment and to support high-technology industries. Simply hoping unemployment will disappear in the white heat of technological revolution does not constitute a viable employment policy.
Most of the needed programs - industrial retraining, creation of jobs in depressed areas, support for community development and labor-intensive programs such as energy conservation and the development of solar energy - are already topics of intense debate. All are needed to tackle the high levels of unemployment, with or without the microelectronic revolution. But the special problems posed by microelectronics also call for some special responses.
First, there is a need for advance warning, consultation and retraining of displaced workers when the new technologies are introduced. Whatever the ultimate benefits of microelectronics, it is clear that there will be serious upheavals in industries where jobs are automated and workers face layoffs.
In the past few years, trade union councils in several European countries have begun to negotiate technology agreements with employers' groups. These can provide useful guidelines for negotiations over the introduction of new technology into local plants.
But for workers who face the prospect of technological unemployment, retraining is essential. More concerted action by both government and industry is needed.
Finally, if the widespread use of microelectronics does usher in a period of ''jobless growth,'' attention must be given to new ways to distribute the benefits. These have traditionally trickled down through higher wages, expansion in the number of jobs and use of tax revenues to support unemployment benefits, pensions and other social programs.
The time may have come to consider how to share work in a highproductivity economy. Proposals to reduce the number of work hours have been raised in negotiations by several European trade unions. A few American unions, which have long resisted such notions, have begun to follow suit. Industry groups have, however, generally opposed these proposals.
Microelectronic technology promises an array of benefits, and the electronic age is already well under way. As it progresses during the last two decades of the 20th century, it will lead to improvements in productivity in factories and offices, changes in the way information is processed, stored and communicated and alterations in the content of many jobs. Like all major technological changes, the transition to microelectronics will raise difficult political issues, among which the impact on jobs and employment is the most prominent.
A combination of revitalized employment policies, greater industrial democracy and new ways of distributing both the hours of work and the fruits of technological change are essential if the benefits of the microelectronic revolution are to be equitably shared. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Colin Norman is a researcher for the Worldwatch Institute.

SOUND; Sound ^ Hans Fantel,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast); New York, N.Y.",1980,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/sound-hans-fantel/docview/423990413/se-2?accountid=14586,"TALKING objects used to exist only in fairy tales. So did objects that would obey commands, such as mountains that would open, brooms that would sweep, or tables that would serve you dinner if you said the right thing.
This in no longer so. Thanks to recent advances in audio technology, inanimate talkers and intelligent furniture are now moving from fairyland into everyday life. For example, there is now a stereo system you can talk to. You say ''On,'' and it switches itself on. When told, it will change stations, turn the volume up or down, start a record or a tape, and do any number of other tricks except sit up and beg or roll over. It also plays music quite nicely. But in view of its other accomplishments, that would seem incidental.
The trend toward machines that talk and listen is not confined to audio alone. Speech recognition and voice response modules can also be built into other kinds of equipment. An oven that discoursed with the cook about the condition of the roast performed to enthusiastic applause at an electronics trade show, and the mind boggles at the further possibilities of such chatty man/machine interaction. Maybe it will revive the art of conversation.
Articulate machines, now in a stage of frenzied development both in this country and Japan, resemble human beings in that talking is easier for them than listening. To talk, the machine merely has to arrange words in its recorded memory (originally spoken by a human) in various programmed sequences. Just what the machine says under certain conditions - or in response to certain questions - is part of the program. Computer-type logic modules make sure the machine says something appropriate.
Listening is harder. Recognizing the sound pattern of certain spoken words or phrases is itself not beyond the ken of ''intelligent'' circuits. The principle is similar to that used in sonar detection, where smart gismos can tell the difference between a dolphin and a submarine. Differences between words of any language can be electronically analyzed and identified in the same way.
The problem for home use is that the machine should recognize the same word as the same word whether it is spoken with a Yankee twang or a Texas drawl - a task that confounds even humans. As one Japanese working in this field recently observed, ''The English language sounds not at all alike in Aberdeen, Scotland, and in Plains, Georgia.'' Plains, it seems, was the only locality in Georgia of which he was cognizant, and so far, he concedes, his gadget remains flummoxed by different voices and accents. What's more, a listening machine should respond to people who lisp and mumble, to males as well as females, and it must be able to sort out human utterances from the hodgepodge of varied background noises made by other machines that populate the modern environment.
Because of these difficulties, the voice-command stereo system recently shown by Toshiba responds only to one voice - that of the person who programmed it in the first place. But, as any fox terrier will tell you, responding only to Its Master's Voice is quite proper for a phonograph.
Once it has recognized such phrases as ''fast forward,'' ''volume up,'' etc., Toshiba's little robot is quite adept at carrying out instructions. It takes this gismo a mere half second to respond to an order, even though its brain - a microprocessor chip smaller than a postage stamp - has to perform thousands of operations in that time.
The Toshiba Acoustic Remote Control System (ARCS), now in advanced prototype, may soon make its commercial debut. Its vocabulary is limited. It registers only 15 words - in any language you choose - but that's enough to cover most of the normal stereo control functions. Just about the only thing it won't do is reach into your record cabinet, pull out the record you want, dust it off and put it on. For that, you'll still have to get out of your chair.
The question remains whether all this makes sense. Or, putting it another way, should a stereo system, like a well-trained dog, be able to obey spoken orders? Whatever the convenience so attained, there is certainly a discrepancy between ends and means. Since the circuitry needed to do all these tricks is quite expensive, the discrepancy lies between high costs and trivial benefits.
This is not to impugn the idea of remote control as such. But it can be accomplished just as well and much more cheaply by pushing buttons. Is it, after all, so much more strenuous to push a button than to say a word?
Pushbutton remote control is now available for several stereo systems made by Kenwood, Fisher, JVC, Bang & Olufsen, Sony, SAE, Aiwa, Akai, and others. They vary in capability, but essentially they allow the listener to adjust volume, select inputs, control tape decks and turntables and select radio stations on an FM tuner from a distance without ever having to leave his chair.
Most of these control devices operate by sending out a coded sequence of infrared-light flashes from the hand-held control unit, which are ''seen'' and interpreted by a special control receiver. This device, in turn, is connected to the various stereo components and instructs them by means of electric pulses to carry out the coded commands.
Components steerable from afar typically run about $200 to $300 more than equivalent sound gear without such automation. How one reacts to these enticements depends on one's priorities and agility. Sportive listeners of Spartan inclinations will probably skip such frills and put the extra money into better sound. To others, the option of remaining seated or supine may be irresistible.",http://primo.lib.umn.edu/openurl/TWINCITIES/TWINCITIES_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Anytimes&amp;atitle=SOUND%3B+Sound+%5E+Hans+Fantel&amp;title=New+York+Times&amp;issn=03624331&amp;date=1980-09-04&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=C.9&amp;au=&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=New+York+Times&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,C,General Interest Periodicals--United States,3624331,"Copyright New York Times Company Sep 4, 1980","This in no longer so.

NEW EFFORT TO MAKE MINES SAFER; Coal's Future Promise and RealitySixth and last of a series.: Â  [series ],"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast); New York, N.Y.",1980,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/new-effort-make-mines-safer-coals-future-promise/docview/424011160/se-2?accountid=14586,"Special to The New York Times
The coal mines are safer now than decades ago, but coal mining is still the most hazardous of industrial jobs. As the United States gears for much greater coal production, there is, within this industry that made itself a byword for labormanagement strife, a recognition on all sides that even an improved safety record is not good enough.
''Today, it is no longer a question of commitment to safety,'' said Michael S. Koleda, who served as director of the President's Coal Commission, appointed by President Carter. ''It is a question of the time it takes to translate a safety commitment in the home office to action at the mines.''
The news from the coal fields is that the ingrained resistance to the costs of safer mines seems to be breaking down. The mine operators - hard-pressed in a fragmented, declining industry -have traditionally fought the added expense of greater safety measures as a threat to production and profit. But increasingly they seem to have concluded that an unsafe mine is the most expensive of all.
''There is no longer any question that a safer mine is a more productive mine,'' Joseph P. Brennan, president of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association, said.
New Approach Sought
Mr. Brennan, a coal miner's son and a former economist for the United Mine Workers union, is among a number of industry leaders seeking to bring a new voice to coal mining that does not ''refight our history.'' And for that group, safety is the paramount common ground.
More than 100,000 American miners have died violently in this century. Hundreds of thousands of others suffer from pneumoconiosis, the disabling ''black lung'' disease. Until 1970, when the current Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act became law over the mine operators' st ubborn resistance, a frequent charge was that the industry cons idered men ''cheaper than coal.''
Today the fatalities, at least, are down. (Injuries are not, perhaps because more of them are being honestly reported.) Thus far this year, 114 persons have died, compared with 127 in the same period last year.
But the current count includes five men killed in an explosion of mine gas, or met hane, on Nov. 7 in a Westmore land Coal Company mine near Madison, W. Va. - exactly the kind of di saster that the 1970 lawwas intended to prevent. And in a 16-day peri od in September and October, 16 miners died, an average of one a day, mostly in solitary encounters with roof falls.
Productivity Is Down
But productivity - the mine owners' foremost worry in opposing the added costs of improved safety - has been down, too. The mine owners blame the new and stringent safety rules in particular and ''government regulation'' in general. They see a bureaucratic invasion where they formerly had a relatively free hand.
There has long been a vast difference of view between those who run the coal mines and those who mine the coal. Mining engineers speak of ''recovering'' the coal, at the end of tunnels as deep as 1,000 feet, from low-ceilinged, subterranean mazes as large as Manhattan Island. Their word ''recover'' reflects the deeply held feeling among mine operators that the coal was always theirs, put there to be taken, like forests to be cut, or fish to be pulled from the sea.
But listen to how one rank-and-filer put it in Congressional testimony years ago, in what has become a classic statement of the miner's dread.
'In Constant Danger'
''You are in constant danger at all times in a coal mine,'' he said. ''You are surrounded by all the tremendous forces of nature, straining against your effort to extract this coal. So you are in a continual struggle. Nature is out to protect its resources, and you are there wrestling the bowels out of the thing. So you are in constant danger in a coal mine.''
In the mines, productivity had roughly doubled between 1950 and 1960, after the introduction of more modern electrohydraulic mining machinery underground and the advent of large-scale strip mining. Some surface mines can produce three to five times the tonnage per man-day of deep mines.
The ''automation'' of coal allowed in the 1950's by the late John L. Lewis, who had been president of the United Mine Workers union, reduced the work force by 246,000 men in 10 years, or by almost its total strength today. It was a decade that saw a crushing increase in the poverty of the Appalachian region.
But after a peak year in 1969, when the average yield per miner's day reached 19.9 tons - it had been 12.2 a decade earlier - there came a sharp decline in productivity, reflecting turmoil in the U.M.W., a rash of wildcat strikes and the new mine safety strictures.
Nonproducing Jobs Filled
A study by the Brookings Institution concluded that between 1969 and 1975, 118,000 new workers were hired by coal operators, many for nonproducing jobs to satisfy provisions of the new safety law. Through 1978, coal mining suffered the sharpest drop in productivity of all industries.
Many of the difficult issues that stretched the 1977-78 miners' strike to a record of 111 days revolved around productivity - for example, the mine operators' insistence on harsh individual penalties to curb wildcat strikes and absenteeism. The operators won most of these issues.
During the current three-year union contract, this discipline has enforced relative labor peace, and productivity has been rising. Bargaining for a new contract is expected to begin early next year, in an atmosphere of good relations.
The 1978 contract also allowed the companies for the first time to pay productivity bonuses, a strategy used successfully by a number of nonunion mines. But the industry contends that, in an experience that parallels the impact of the mine safety act in the 1970's, new environmental controls are driving strip-mine productivity down while wages rise, passing $88 a day in the East and $110 a day in the West. Safety Performance Varies
There seems no longer any doubt that wide variations in talent and outlook in board rooms and in mine superintendents' offices can make an important difference in mine safety.
Invading an area of ''proprietary data'' that has long been a coal industry taboo, the President's Coal Commission earlier this year published a r anking of the mine safety performance of the 20 largest producers. Th e commission, headed by Gov. John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia , was appointed by President Carter.
The commission, which had a broad mandate to review every aspect of the industry, prepared a table that showed dramatic differences: The mines of the United States Steel Corporation, where safety costs are not stinted, were seven times safer than those of Westmoreland Coal, the large producer with the worst safety record. ''It shows that somebody is doing something right,'' Mr. Koleda, the commission director , said. ''It can be done.''
According to one coal industry officer, the profit pressures are lighter in the ''captive'' mines of the steel industry. ''Production costs in the mines are a paper transfer against the ultimate cost of steel,'' he explained, ''so there is a longstanding, historic reason that the steel industry mines have perfected the safety systems, procedures and training that make this difference.''
Dismissals in Mine Blast
In what may be a coal industry first, Westmoreland not only publicly accepted immediate and full responsibility for the West Virginia mine explosion earlier this month, but also summarily relieved the top two managers of the Ferrell Mine ''in anticipation that there may be criminal charges against them,'' as a company spokesman put it.
Like the gap in the safety numbers, productivity differences among mine operations are affected by natural factors - difficult geology, low seams and so on. The President's commission found that there was no direct relationship between the safety and the productivity of its listed mines. The connection was ''random,'' the commission said.
Men like Mr. Brennan of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association stress the importance of worker morale, and of a labor-management policy of ''cooperation rather than confrontation,'' both in the pits and at the bargaining table. The coal union and Mr. Brennan's association have been demonstrating at several levels how cooperation can work - without totally abandoning the old adversary postures.
Safety Program Set Up
Under the current contract, they have made a series of amicable joint statements on safety and other issues, and they are jointly operating a training course for mine safety committeemen, the rankand-filers chosen by their peers to be the safety watchdogs in the mines.
Without enlightenment at the end of the tunnel, Mr. Brennan says, coal mining will miss the opportunity that history is giving it to become ''a new industry.''
Whatever zeal there will be in the Reagan administration to curtail the regulatory functions of government, it is not expected to seriously affect mine safety rules. The Reagan transition liaison at the Labor Department, which runs the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration, is Richard Schubert, a vice chairman of Bethlehem Steel, who is widely regarded as an uncompromising safety advocate.

THE HIGH PRICE OF WOMEN'S SHOES: FROM DRAWING BOARD TO STORE,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast); New York, N.Y.",1980,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/high-price-womens-shoes-drawing-board-store/docview/423957025/se-2?accountid=14586,"Anyone who's old enough to remember the late 1950's, when the fashionable shoe to wear was a Herbert Levine kidskin pump for $25, can't help but wince at today's shoe prices: $120 for a basic pump, $155 for a fisherman's sandal.
It's no use saying that prices have gone up all over. Everyone knows that. But why are shoes so expensive? Why should a few strips of leather cost $100 or more?
Basically, it's because the leather in a shoe represents only a fraction of what a shopper ultimately pays for. The price of shoes is determined by three factors: materials, labor and overhead.
But each of these is complicated when one is dealing with the production of high-quality women's shoes, which are not mass-produced but are still made, to a great extent, by hand.
Many components go into a shoe. In addition to the leather used for the uppers, or outside of the shoe, there are lining and interlining, sole and innersole, toe box, shank and heel, plus tacks, glue and thread. A lot of time may go into working out a design and perfecting the ''last,'' or the form that is the shoemaker's equivalent of a pattern. The original form is made of wood, the working lasts of plastic -one for each size. Each operation in the manufacturing process is handled by a different worker: One cuts the leather, another pulls it over the form, another guides it through stitching and finishing machines. Still other workers polish the shoes, put in labels and box them.
Trimmings Increase Costs
If shoes are made abroad, customs and shipping expenses are also added. Erasmo La Marca, owner of La Marca Shoes, supplied the breakdown of costs for the diagram and box accompanying this article. He said the basic cost would go up if there were any trimmings on the shoe, such as buttons, buckles or bows, or any detailing such as stitching or cutouts or appliques that required extra labor. His own shoes for this fall start at $150.
''If a factory can turn out 200 pairs a day but details bring the production down to 125 pairs, the cost must be averaged out,'' said Mr. La Marca. ''The price of each shoe is calculated after the whole collection is complete. We figure out how much time, materials, and so forth are involved. It's impossible to calculate cost by materials alone.''
The shoes sold in the La Marca store at 43 East 57th Street are designed by his wife, Arlene, and made for them in Italy. ''You must also realize,'' Mr. La Marca said, ''that if shoes come in to an importer rather than directly to a retailer, the importer adds maybe 20 to 35 percent for his expenses. Then the stores he sells to mark up the shoes again to cover their expenses.''
Fashion Is a Factor
Another factor adding to the cost of footwear is fashion. ''When you're making high-fashion shoes,'' Mr. La Marca said, ''you must change the lasts and components every season. The most difficult part is not making the shoes but making the sample. It may take two weeks or more to perfect the sample.''
The best-selling fisherman sandal of Susan Bennis/Warren Edwards was $95 when it was introduced four years ago. Now it costs $155. ''But if we had to develop that shoe today, it would cost twice as much,'' said Miss Bennis, who with her partner designs and manufactures (in Italy) all the shoes for their shop, soon to move from 122 East 55th Street to 440 Park Avenue at 56th Street.
She mentioned all of the elements that have been increasing the price of shoes, including the high inflation rate in Italy where ''the labor unions' demands increase all the time.''
In that case, why do so many manufacturers continue to use Italian factories? ''Because the workers are artisans,'' said Miss Bennis. ''Because the Italians make the best-quality shoes,'' said David Evins, who had a factory in New York for many years before switching to Italy five years ago. ''There was once an industry here, but young people didn't want to go into it any more. In Italy, it's different. It's a tradition there. They have training schools and an apprenticeship.''
Arthur Samuels Jr. of the Golo Footwear Corporation, a 65-year-old company that makes $40-to-$70 shoes at its factory in Scranton, Pa., said: ''We don't have the hands in this country to make a $200 shoe. We don't have the artistry, the craftsmanship. What we're trying to do at Golo is give the best value for the money. We can make shoes in America in our price range that are a better value than if we made them abroad. But you can't compare our shoes with fine Italian shoes. Their work is much more refined. If a woman doesn't see the fineness, the details, she can be happy with less expensive shoes.''
The decline of the American shoe industry was examined in a report to Congress by the Comptroller General that was published earlier this year. It is entitled ''Slow Productivity Growth in the U.S.Footwear Industry - Can the Federal Government Help?''
Tough Foreign Competition
The report concludes that the industry lost much of its vitality because of continuing foreign competition. ''From 1968 to 1978,'' the report says, ''domestic shoe production dropped 37 percent, imports rose 106 percent, and almost 76,000 people lost their jobs.''
According to the study, there were 970 footwear manufacturers in this country in 1954; today there are 340, the majority of which make shoes that sell for less than $14 retail.
In the mid-1950's, domestic manufacturers produced 99 percent of the shoes sold here, the report says, but by last year imports had captured 52 percent of the market. Most of the shoes come from Taiwan, Italy, Spain, Brazil, Hong Kong and Korea.
One of the solutions suggested by the Government report is automation, which, it says, ''may offer an opportunity for domestic manufacturers to increase their productivity and gain a competitive advantage over foreign producers.''
However, it does acknowledge that new machinery may be beyond the means of small- and medium-sized companies. And then there are manufacturers such as Howard Fox of Manhattan, who is more interested in quality than quantity. He said he might be interested in a machine that did a better job than one he already had but not one that speeded up only one portion of the operation. ''The rest of my factory couldn't keep up,'' he commented. Hands at Every Step
The 80 employees in his factory on lower Broadway can produce 400 pairs a day, he said, working much like those at a fine Italian shoe factory where human hands are involved in every step. The Fox Shoe Manufacturing Corporation makes $85 to $95 shoes that are sold in department stores. The company has been supplying Saks Fifth Avenue's Fenton Last for more than 40 years.
''To make my shoes in Italy,'' Mr. Fox said, ''would cost 20 percent more because of the added expenses of customs, shipping and so forth.''
Among the ways manufacturers are trying to keep shoe prices down are by looking for countries where labor is cheaper and by using synthetic materials where feasible.
Super Shoe-Biz, a New York-based concern, has gone to South America and to China seeking cheap labor for some of its shoes. Patterns and components are taken there for assembling, according to Geoffrey Hutchinson, vice president. Chinese-made sandals with leather uppers and synthetic soles were $30 in stores in New York this spring.
Although shoe prices in general have gone up 10 percent or more every year for the last 10 years, there are indications of a leveling off. Manufacturers report that leather prices have dropped recently.
Gilbert Fields, president of the Marx & Newman Company, which makes both David Evins shoes selling for $85 to $150 and Bandolinos selling for $50 to $60, said, ''Although labor in Italy jumped 13 to 14 percent this year, leather prices are down for the first time in several years. So our prices for spring 1981 won't go up. Decreases in leather prices have offset increases in labor.''
One way to cope with the high price of shoes is to shop the discount stores. While the range of styles and sizes is limited, savings of 12 percent or more may make a visit worthwhile. Here is a sampling of stores:
Jerri's, 538 Second Avenue (30th Street), 889-6491. Good selection of Yves Saint Laurent, Anne Klein, Bandolino, Joan and David, Customcraft. Ralph Lauren cowboy boots now on sale for $97. Jerri's store at 2611 Broadway (98th Street) currently closed for renovation, will reopen in early August.

''When you're making high-fashion shoes,'' Mr. [Erasmo La Marca] said, ''you must change the lasts and components every season. The most difficult part is not making the shoes but making the sample. It may take two weeks or more to perfect the sample.'' In that case, why do so many manufacturers continue to use Italian factories? ''Because the workers are artisans,'' said Miss [Bennis]. ''Because the Italians make the best-quality shoes,'' said David Evins, who had a factory in New York for many years before switching to Italy five years ago. ''There was once an industry here, but young people didn't want to go into it any more. In Italy, it's different. It's a tradition there. They have training schools and an apprenticeship.''

MAJOR NEWS IN SUMMARY; A Resounding Finale for the Supreme Court,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast); New York, N.Y.",1980,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/major-news-summary-resounding-finale-supreme/docview/423955571/se-2?accountid=14586,"Unlike lower courts, which carry backlogs over the summer, the United States Supreme Court clears its calendar and its members' desks of all cases argued during the term. Last week, the Court ended its 1979-80 season with a year-end sweep of rulings, including three of the most controversial decisions faced this term.
Abortion-Funds Ban
If the Government pays for virtually all other medical services required by the poor, can it constitutionally deny funds for abortions deemed medically necessary? Voting 5 to 4, the Supreme Court said ''yes.''
At issue was the Hyde Amendment, the rider to the Federal budget denying Medicaid payments for abortions except where the life of the mother is in danger or in instances of promptly reported rape or incest. Struck down by a Federal judge in Brooklyn, this ban must now be revived.
Writing for the majority, Associate Justice Potter Stewart concluded that in the amendment ''Congress has established incentives that make childbirth a more attractive alternative than abortions for persons eligible for Medicaid'' - incentives ''rationally related'' to the Government's ''legitimate interest'' in protecting the life of the fetus, and thus permitted under the Constitution's rubric of equal protection. (How the Court set social policy, page 4.)
Anti-abortion forces saw the case, Harris v. McRae, as a last legal chance to limit the availability of abortions by limiting funds. (Medicaid-funded abortions have averaged 250,000 to 300,000 yearly.)
Recent studies by a Planned Parenthood of America affiliate showed that without funding, the rate of abortions for women eligible for Medicaid dropped by 23 percent in Ohio and 18 percent in Georgia. Federal data indicated very few women were resorting to illegal or self-induced abortions.
In favoring the anti-abortion position, however, McRae may have pointed the way to that faction's ultimate goal - passage of a constitutional amendment banning abortions. For in removing the Federal Government from the picture, the Court allowed that individual states are free to continue paying their share for the service. Twenty-two do so, and it is likely that groups opposing this will now direct their attention to legislatively eating away at abortion rights.
Racial Preference
Although not so celebrated as the Bakke decision, the Supreme Court ruling in Fullilove v. Klutznick last week may be more significant in its effect on programs based on preferential treatment by race.
At stake were the circumstances under which the Government can set up race-based classifications and award its benefits. Voting 6 to 3, the Court endorsed the power of Congress to require affirmative action. It held constitutional a Federal requirement that 10 percent of all contracts awarded under a $4 billion public works program go to ''minority business enterprises.''
The Justices themselves, however, faced the issue of adhering to the Constitution's mandate of color-blindness and to its implied obligation for Government to help overcome the legacy of discrimination.
Chief Justice Warren E. Burger noted, writing for the majority, ''We reject the contention that in the remedial context, the Congress must act in a wholly 'color-blind' fashion.''
In a strong dissent, Justice Stewart wrote: ''Because of the Court's decision today, our statute books will once again have to contain laws that reflect the odious practice of delineating the qualities that make one person a Negro and make another white.''
Similar issues were raised in 1978 when, in the case of Allan P. Bakke, the Court invalidated a California medical school's admissions quota. The Court said then, however, that racial considerations were not of themselves automatically unconstitutional.
Rights of the Press
Journalists sometimes go where others fear to tread and, it is sometimes said, where they have no business being. But the acquisition of ''newsworthy matter,'' according to a majority of the Supreme Court, is entitled to constitutional protections that take it through the courthouse doors.
Ruling 7 to 1, in Richmond Newspapers v. Virginia, the Court for the first time interpreted First Amendment guarantees of free speech, free press and free assembly as further guarantees to the public, and to the press as the public's surrogate, of access to public institutions, specifically to criminal trials.
In a 1979 case involving public access to legal proceedings, Gannett v. DePasquale, the Court majority chose the Sixth Amendment right to a public trial as the basis of decision. It approved clearing a courtroom for pretrial hearings on the admissibility of evidence. The decision has plagued the Court for a year, as some judges have used it to close doors on other proceedings. While last week's decision does not overrule Gannett, it does repudiate much of its rationale.
Moscow Gives Schmidt a Boost
Unlike the Moscow Olympics or grain sales, nuclear weapons control is too important to be held hostage to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. So last week, the Carter Administration reacted with cautious approval when Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West Germany reported the Russians were ready for negotiations on missiles in Europe. The proposal will be studied ''in a constructive spirit,'' said Secretary of State Edmund S. Muskie, although other Administration officials remained wary.
Soviet leaders had previously refused to discuss arms control on the continent before a) the United States had ratified the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty and b) the North Atlantic Treaty allies had repudiated their decision to deploy United States medium-range missiles against new Soviet weapons targeted on Western Europe.
First sending Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher to advise President Carter that European resistance to the American missiles would now be eased, Mr. Schmidt then reported the ''new and constructive proposal'' to Bundestag supporters eager to nurture detente. Radio Moscow proclaimed a break in ''the stalemate which for months blocked all talks.'' But Mr. Schmidt warned the dialogue would be lengthy and difficult, with unforeseeable results.
Among the complications, the Russians want ''forward-based'' United States aircraft in Europe - F-111 bombers and F-4 nuclear-armed fighters - included in negotiations. Not so fast, said NATO officials, insisting these weapons are for defense over Europe, not to hit Soviet territory. The Russians also said SALT II must be ratified before European missile ceilings could take effect.
On Afghanistan, the Russians rejected Mr. Schmidt's demand for complete troop withdrawal. But, the Chancellor reported, ''Moscow clearly recognizes the necessity for finding a political solution.'' Smoothing over initial doubts over the West German leader's his mission to Moscow, President Carter sent ''warm appreciation'' for his strong Afghanistan statement.
Some Washington officials fear, however, that Western efforts to pressure the Russians on Afghanistan, notably by restricting technology sales, may be diverted by a new missile negotiation. Indeed, during Mr. Schmidt's Moscow visit, accords were signed on automation, data processing, atomic energy and oil exploration. A $13.3 billion gas pipeline from Siberia to West Germany was Bonn's biggest economic prize.
A Fiscal Migraine In City Labor Pacts
New York City last week reached peaceable agreement with the last of its unions. But there was not much joy among union members, who know there will be layoffs to help pay for their raises, or among taxpayers, who must foot the bill, or among the money overseers, who must supervise the collections and disbursements.
There was, nevertheless, satisfaction when Mayor Koch and the uniformed union leaders announced their 11th-hour agreement. Nicholas Mancuso, president of the Uniformed Firefighters Association, called it an ''acceptable settlement.'' It will give pay increases of 9 percent the first year and 8 percent the second, plus higher allowances for uniforms and other side benefits. Mayor Koch said from the same platform: ''What's nice about this is that everybody came out of it with honor and dignity.''
The city also came out of it with a projected $1 billion deficit for fiscal 1982, and after the smiles faded, the Mayor's advisers set about finding more money. The Mayor said at a later news conference that ''this is not something we see as a huge problem in 1981,'' but the projected gap in the 1982 budget meant ''expenditure reductions and increased taxes.'' Layoffs, he said, should be expected.
To make up for the shortfall, Mayor Koch said he would ask the City Council to do what it refused to do last month: impose a 10-cent increase in the real estate tax, which would bring in $35 million. There was talk of other measures, among them new taxes on services such as residential garbage collection.
Fiscal monitors are worried whether private investors and Washington, which is being depended upon for loan guarantees, will be impressed by what Mr. Koch calls the first city budget in years to be balanced without gimmicks, or by the possibility that, by committing cash it does not have, the city in 1982 may be heading for a replay of the brinksmanship of 1975. (Public safety strikes across the nation, page 6.)
